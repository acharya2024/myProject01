                                <p>Distance is a measure of the actual path length traversed by an object between two
                                    points. It is important to note that distance is a property of the path taken, not
                                    just the initial and final positions. It also inherently involves a time interval
                                    over which the motion occurs.</p>

                                <p>Average speed is defined as the total distance traveled divided by the total time
                                    taken. Mathematically, it can be expressed as:</p>
                                <p>
                                    \( \qquad \text{Average Speed} = \dfrac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} \)
                                </p>

                                        <p> Now, the question arises: how small can we set \(h\)? An obvious answer
                                            might be \(h = 0\), but this leads to problems: </p>

                                                <p> \(\qquad \dfrac{4 + 4h + h^2 - 4}{h} = (4 + h) \, \text{m/s}\), </p>
                                                <p> we canceled \(h\) from the numerator and denominator. If \(h = 0\),
                                                    we can no longer perform this cancellation, making the calculation

                                        </ul>
                                        <p> To resolve this, we let \(h\) approach zero, denoted as \(h \to 0\). This
                                            means \(h\) becomes infinitesimally close to zero but never exactly zero. By
                                            doing so, we ensure a non-zero observation interval while also allowing us
                                            to simplify the calculation. </p>
                                        <p> As \(h \to 0\), the average speed calculated as \((4 + h) \, \text{m/s}\)
                                            approaches \(4 \, \text{m/s}\), because \(h\) becomes negligible when added
                                            to 4. </p>
                                        <p> Thus, the instantaneous speed of the particle at \(t = 2 \, \text{s}\) is
                                            \(4 \, \text{m/s}\). </p>
                                        <p> This process demonstrates how instantaneous speed is the limit of average
                                            speed over infinitesimally small time intervals. We will explore this
                                            concept further in the next section. </p>
                                        <p>
                                            Now with a more formal approach, let us try to calculate speed at any
                                            general time \(t\).

                                        <p>As \(\Delta t\) approaches zero (written as \(\Delta t \to 0\)),
                                            \(v_{\text{avg}}\) approaches \(2t\). Therefore, the instantaneous speed
                                            \(v\) at any time \(t\) is \(2t\).</p>
                                        <p>This means that the rate of change of \(t^2\) with respect to \(t\) is
                                            \(2t\). In calculus, we say that the <em>derivative</em> of \(t^2\) is

                                    Instantaneous speed represents how fast an object is moving at a specific instant in
                                    time.
                                    It's like taking the concept of average speed and shrinking the time interval until
                                    it becomes
                                    infinitesimally small. This allows us to measure the rate of change of position at
                                    an exact moment.

                                    Mathematically, if \(x\) represents the position of an object at time \(t\), the
                                    instantaneous speed \(v\) is defined as:

                                    This formula introduces the concept of <strong>differentiation</strong>, represented
                                    by \(\dfrac{dx}{dt}\),
                                    which means "the rate of change of position (\(x\)) with respect to time (\(t\))."
                                    It tells us how much
                                    the position changes for an infinitesimally small change in time.

                                    Differentiation allows us to calculate instantaneous rates of change, such as speed.
                                    It's a powerful tool
                                    in physics and mathematics. For example, in the function \(x = t^2\), the derivative
                                    tells us how \(x\)
                                    changes with time. The mathematical result for its derivative is written as:
                                </p>
                                <p>

                                    Understanding differentiation is easiest when we apply it to specific examples.
                                    Let's calculate the
                                    instantaneous speed for different types of motion. FOllowing examples contain
                                    different expressions of distance \(x\) in meters depending on \(t\) in seconds.
                                    Lets find dependence of speed \(v\) on time in each case.

                                <p>For example, consider a particle that starts at \(x = 0\), moves to \(x = +5\) m in 2
                                    seconds, and then to \(x
                                    = +2\) m in another 3 seconds. Lets find its average velocity in following steps:
                                </p>

                                <p>\(\qquad\)Displacement (0 to 2s) = \(+5\) m. </p>

                                <p>\(\qquad\)Total Displacement (0 to 5s) = \(+2\) m. </p>

                                <p><strong>Instantaneous Velocity</strong></p>
                                <p>Instantaneous velocity, similar to instantaneous speed, is the velocity at a specific
                                    moment. Instantaneous velocity at a time \(t\) is the average velocity from time
                                    \(t\) to time \(t+\Delta t\) such that the time interval \(\Delta t\) is
                                    infinitesimally small (\(\Delta t\to0\)). It's the
                                    rate of change of displacement with respect to time. We calculate it using
                                    differentiation:</p>
                                <p>\( \qquad v = \dfrac{dx}{dt}\)</p>
                                <p>The difference between instantaneous speed and velocity is that velocity includes
                                    direction (positive or
                                    negative in one dimension). A negative velocity means the object is moving in the
                                    negative
                                    x-direction.</p>
