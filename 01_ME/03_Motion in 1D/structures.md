Okay, I agree. Presenting vectors as a foundational chapter before diving into 2D motion is a sound pedagogical approach. This will ensure students have a solid grasp of the necessary mathematical tools before applying them to physics problems.

Here's a proposed structure for a dedicated chapter on Vectors:

### Vectors: Mathematical Toolkit for Physics

**I. Introduction to Vectors**

*   What are vectors? Distinguishing vectors from scalars (with examples).
*   Importance of vectors in physics (representing displacement, velocity, force, etc.).
*   Geometric representation of vectors: magnitude and direction.
*   Notation: boldface (`**A**`), arrow over letter (`\(\overrightarrow{A}\)`).
*   Definition of unit vectors: A vector with magnitude 1. Its representation `\(\hat{A}\)`
*   Importance of unit vectors in defining direction.
*   Standard unit vectors in 2D (`**i**`, `**j**`) and 3D (`**i**`, `**j**`, `**k**`).

**II. Vector Algebra**

*   **A. Equality of Vectors:**
    *   Definition: Two vectors are equal if they have the same magnitude and direction.

*   **B. Vector Addition:**
    *   Geometric methods: Triangle law, parallelogram law, polygon law.
    *   Component method: Adding vectors by adding their corresponding components.
    *   Practice problems: A set of displacements given and their resultant to be calculated. At least 5 problems
*   **C. Vector Subtraction:**
    *   Definition: Subtracting a vector is equivalent to adding its negative.
    *   Geometric interpretation.
    *   Component method.
    *   Practice problems: A set of displacements given and their difference to be calculated. At least 3 problems

*   **D. Scalar Multiplication:**
    *   Multiplying a vector by a scalar changes its magnitude (and possibly direction if the scalar is negative).
    *   Component method.

**III. Vector Decomposition and Components**

*   Resolving a vector into its components along orthogonal axes (typically x and y).
*   Finding components given magnitude and direction:
    *   `Ax = A cos θ`
    *   `Ay = A sin θ`
*   Finding magnitude and direction given components:
    *   `A = √(Ax^2 + Ay^2)`
    *   `θ = arctan(Ay/Ax)` (Careful with quadrant!).
*   Decomposition of vectors into their x, y and z-components.

**IV. Problem practice: Decomposition of vectors**
*   With directions and magnitudes of vector given, to be plotted in a dynamic graph and its i,j and k components to be written in input box (completely handled by javascript) [TO BE MADE LATER]

**V. Vector Multiplication**

*   **A. Scalar Product (Dot Product):**
    *   Definition: `**A** · **B** = A B cos θ`.
    *   Geometric interpretation: Projection of one vector onto another.
    *   Component form: `**A** · **B** = AxBx + AyBy + AzBz`.
    *   Properties: Commutative, distributive.
    *   Applications: Finding the angle between two vectors, calculating work done by a force.
    *   Each part to be supported with illustrative examples

*   **B. Vector Product (Cross Product):**
    *   Definition: `|**A** × **B**| = A B sin θ`.
    *   Direction: Perpendicular to both `**A**` and `**B**`, determined by the right-hand rule.
    *   Component form (in 3D):  (Provide the determinant formula).
    *   Properties: Anti-commutative, distributive.
    *   Applications: Calculating torque, angular momentum, area of a parallelogram.
    *   Each part to be supported with illustrative examples
    *   Practice problems: At least 3 problems

**VI. Practice Problems**

*   Problems covering vector addition, subtraction, scalar multiplication, dot product, cross product, and vector decomposition.
*   Problems of varying difficulty levels.
*   Answer key with step-by-step solutions.
*   Practice problems: A set of displacements given and their difference to be calculated. At least 3 problems
