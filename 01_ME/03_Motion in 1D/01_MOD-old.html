                                    Distance is a scalar quantity that measures the total length of the path traveled by
                                    an object. It depends on the actual path taken and does not consider direction. The
                                    measurement of distance requires a reference starting point and is associated with a
                                    specific time interval.

                                    Average speed is the total distance traveled divided by the total time taken. It
                                    provides a single value that represents the overall rate of motion during the
                                    journey, irrespective of the path's shape or direction.

                                    This section focuses on solving problems related to average speed when the speed of a particle varies during its motion. Various cases are analyzed to illustrate the concept in different scenarios.

                                            <p>
                                                If the total distance \(d\) and total time \(t\) are given, the average speed is:

                                                <strong>Explanation:</strong> Average speed is the simplest measure of how fast something travels over a journey. It depends only on the total distance covered and the total time taken, regardless of variations in speed during the journey.

                                                If a particle travels for equal time intervals \(t_1 = t_2 = \frac{t}{2}\) with speeds \(v_1\) and \(v_2\), the average speed is:

                                                <strong>Explanation:</strong> Since the time intervals are equal, the average speed is simply the arithmetic mean of the two speeds. This is because the time spent at each speed is identical.

                                                <strong>Explanation:</strong> In this case, the average speed takes into account the weighted contribution of each speed based on the time spent at that speed.
