                                    Rotational mechanics is an important part of physics that explains how objects turn
                                    around a fixed point or axis. This chapter aims to give you a clear understanding of
                                    key ideas like moment of inertia, torque, and angular momentum—concepts that are
                                    widely used, from opening a door to running complex machines.

                                    To better understand why rotational mechanics matters, let's look at some common
                                    examples that use its principles:

                                            When you push or pull on a door handle, you create torque, causing the door
                                            to swing on its hinges. This shows how applying force at a distance from the
                                            pivot point generates torque and leads to rotational motion. The farther
                                            from the hinge you apply the force, the less effort you need to turn the
                                            door.

                                            The circular movement of pedals and wheels is a clear example of rotational
                                            mechanics. Pressing on the pedals creates torque that turns the wheels,
                                            making the bicycle move forward. We will explore the details of these forces
                                            and torques in this chapter.

                                            Using a screwdriver, you apply force in a circular path, causing the screw
                                            to rotate. The screw's spiral shape changes this rotational motion into
                                            straight-line motion, allowing it to go into a surface. This shows how
                                            design works hand in hand with rotational mechanics.

                                            principles affect many industries, renewable energy devices like wind
                                            turbines, and even medical equipment such as CT scanners.

                                    A key term in this field is the "rigid body," an ideal object where the distance
                                    between any two points stays the same, no matter what external forces act on it.
                                    While it's a theoretical concept, it simplifies real-world calculations. For
                                    example, rods, disks, and spheres are often considered rigid bodies to make
                                    computations easier, unlike flexible objects like springs or pieces of cloth.

                                    Understanding the concept of a rigid body and its types of motion—translation and
                                    rotation—is fundamental in rotational mechanics.

                                    <strong>Rigid Body:</strong> A rigid body is defined as an idealized solid object in
                                    which the distance between any two given points remains constant, regardless of
                                    external forces applied to it. This concept simplifies the analysis of
                                    mechanical systems by neglecting deformations. Any type of motion of a rigid body
                                    can be considered as either one of following motions or a combination of following
                                    two types of motions:

                                        <strong>:</strong> A rigid body is said to perform
                                        rotation if all particles of the body perform circular motion such that centers
                                        of
                                        all circles lie on a fixed line. This line is called axis of rotation.
                                        Following are a few examples of rigid body performing rotation:

                                <p>Since each particle moves in a circular path, their velocities relate to the angular
                                    velocity \( \omega \) through \( v_i = r_i \omega \). Substituting this relation,
                                    the kinetic energy becomes:</p>
                                <p>\(\qquad KE_{\text{total}} = \tfrac{1}{2} m_1 (r_1 \omega)^2 + \tfrac{1}{2} m_2 (r_2
                                    \omega)^2 + \tfrac{1}{2} m_3 (r_3 \omega)^2 \)</p>
                                <p>\(\Rightarrow\quad KE_{\text{total}} = \tfrac{1}{2} \omega^2 (m_1 r_1^2 + m_2 r_2^2 +
                                    m_3 r_3^2) \)</p>
                                <p>In linear motion, the kinetic energy is \( KE = \tfrac{1}{2} m v^2 \), where \( m \)
                                    represents inertia—the resistance to changes in motion, and \( v \) is the linear
                                    velocity, the rate of change of linear position. Similarly, in rotational motion, \(
                                    \omega \) is the angular velocity, the rate of change of angular position. The term
                                    within the brackets in the previous equation acts as the rotational inertia and is
                                    defined as the <strong>moment of inertia</strong> \( I \):</p>
                                <p>\(\qquad I = m_1 r_1^2 + m_2 r_2^2 + m_3 r_3^2 \)</p>
                                <p>Thus, the kinetic energy of the rotating system simplifies to:</p>
                                <p>\(\qquad KE_{\text{total}} = \tfrac{1}{2} I \omega^2 \)</p>
                                <p>The moment of inertia, denoted by \( I \), quantifies the resistance of an object to
                                    changes in its rotational motion. It serves as the rotational analogue to mass in
                                    translational motion and is influenced by both the mass of the object and its
                                    distribution relative to the axis of rotation.</p>

                                                To determine the moment of inertia for such bodies, we conceptualize the

                                                elements. By dividing the entire body into these tiny pieces, we can
                                                calculate the moment of inertia for each individual element and then sum
                                                their contributions. This summation process is simmilar to that for

                                                The moment of inertia \(dI\) of an individual particle of mass \(dm\)
                                                located at a distance \(r\) from axis of rotation is given as:

                                                So the total moment of inertia \(I\) of complete mass \(M\) is written
                                                as:

                                                By integrating over the entire mass of

                                                elements, yielding the total moment of inertia.

                                                In summary, calculating the moment of inertia for continuous bodies
                                                involves
                                                breaking down the mass distribution into infinitesimal elements,
                                                determining
                                                the moment of inertia for each element, and integrating these

                                                across the entire volume of the object. This process is shown in
