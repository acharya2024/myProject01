                                    The concept of capacitance can be best explained
                                    with an analogy: consider two rooms where
                                    people enter one after another. Room 1 has less space; consequently, even
                                    with a smaller number
                                    of people inside, the room gets crowded and its discomfort level (analogous to
                                    potential) increases rapidly. In contrast, room 2 offers more space, requiring a
                                    larger number of
                                    people
                                    to achieve the same discomfort level as room 1. The space required or size of a
                                    room here defines its capacitance in electrical systems, determining how much
                                    charge the conductor can hold
                                    at a specific potential level.</p>

                                        spherical charged conductor, the external shell lowers the central conductor's
                                        potential. Thus
                                        placing grounded/conducting cover near isolated charged conductors, reduces
                                        their potential, hence increase capacitance</li>
