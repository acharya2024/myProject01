                                    In physics, the area of a surface is often regarded as a vector quantity. For a
                                    small, flat surface \(S\), its area vector is defined as the vector perpendicular
                                    (normal) to the surface, having a magnitude equal to the area of \(S\). By this
                                    convention, all area vectors for closed surfaces (such as those on spheres or
                                    cuboids) point outward, consistent with outward-facing normals.

                                    The 3D diagrams below help visualize this concept: each face or patch of a shape has
                                    an area vector that points away from the enclosed region.

                                    Just like any other vector, area vectors can be broken down into components. If the
                                    area vector for a surface is \(\vec{A}\), it can be written as:
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    \(\quad \vec{A} = A_x \hat{i} \;+\; A_y \hat{j} \;+\; A_z \hat{k}\).
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Here, \(A_x\) is the portion of the area vector pointing along the \(x\)-axis (i.e.,
                                    corresponding to the surface's projection in the \(y\)-\(z\) plane), \(A_y\) along
                                    the \(y\)-axis (projection in the \(x\)-\(z\) plane), and \(A_z\) along the
                                    \(z\)-axis (projection in the \(x\)-\(y\) plane). The diagram below illustrates the
                                    decomposition of an area vector into these components.

                                    The area of the inclined surface in the diagram above is \( l \times b \). This
                                    surface is inclined at an angle \(\theta\) with respect to the horizontal plane. As
                                    a result, the projection of the inclined surface onto the horizontal plane forms an
                                    area of \( l b \cos\theta \), while the projection onto the vertical plane forms an
                                    area of \( l b \sin\theta \). This approach is consistent with the method of
                                    resolving any vector, such as force or displacement, into two perpendicular
                                    components.

                                    These ideas extend naturally to curved surfaces. For a curved surface, the total
                                    area vector \(\vec{S}\) is the sum (or integral) of all the infinitesimal area
                                    vectors \(d\vec{S}\). Each \(d\vec{S}\) corresponds to a small
                                    patch on the curved surface, oriented perpendicularly outward. By integrating over
                                    the entire surface—like a spherical cap—the contributions from these small patches
                                    combine to form one resultant area vector. In the diagram below, many small arrows
                                    represent these elemental area vectors, and the large arrow stands for their overall
                                    sum \(\vec{S}\).

                                    Notice that if the shape is symmetric about a vertical axis (like a dome), the
                                    vertical components of the infinitesimal area vectors add up along that axis.
                                    Consequently, when calculating the total, you can consider only the projections of
                                    these small patches onto the horizontal plane. Each patch's vertical component
                                    (\(d\vec{S}_\text{vertical}\)) sums to give the resultant \(\vec{S}\). The

                                    In essence, the total area vector of a curved surface can be obtained by summing all
                                    these projected (vertical) components. If you project that curved surface onto the
                                    horizontal plane, you get a shape whose area vector matches the net result of the
                                    curved surface itself. The figure below highlights this idea, showing that for two
                                    surfaces sharing the same boundary—one curved and one flat—the final area vectors
                                    are identical.

                                    Solid angles are the three-dimensional equivalents of the familiar two-dimensional
                                    angles that measure how wide something appears in a plane. In 2D, an arc subtends an
                                    angle at the center of a circle, while in 3D, the base of a cone subtends a solid
                                    angle at its apex. The following 3D model illustrates this concept:

                                    To understand solid angles, let's begin with the idea of plane angles in two
                                    dimensions. In 2D geometry, a plane angle \( \alpha \) is defined by the ratio of a
                                    circle's arc length to its radius:
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    \(\qquad
                                    \alpha = \dfrac{\text{arc length}(l)}{\text{radius}(r)}
                                    \)<equationDetail>[For planer angle]</equationDetail>
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The standard unit for plane angles is the radian (\(\mathrm{rad}\)), with one full
                                    revolution around a circle measuring \( 2\pi \, \mathrm{rad} \). Extending this
                                    concept to three dimensions gives us solid angles. A solid angle \( \Omega \) is
                                    defined as the ratio of an area on a sphere to the square of its radius:

                                    \Omega = \dfrac{\text{area on the sphere}}{\text{(radius)}^2}=\dfrac{{\Delta
                                    A}}{{r}^2}

                                <p>
                                    When the radius of the sphere is set to 1 (a unit sphere), \( \Omega \) is simply
                                    the
                                    area an object projects onto that sphere. The standard unit for solid angles is the
                                    steradian (\(\mathrm{sr}\)).
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    To visualize solid angles, imagine a sphere of radius 1 centered at a point \( O \).
                                    Any object or surface around \( O \) casts a “shadow” on the surface of this
                                    unit sphere. The area of this shadow corresponds to the solid angle subtended by the
                                    object. Hence, we define the solid angle as:
                                </p>
                                <p class="text-center text-law">
                                    Solid angle subtended by an object \(B\) at a point \(O\) is the projection of \(B\)
                                    onto a spherical surface of unit radius centered at \(O\).

                                    The 3D model below shows the solid angle \(\Omega\) subtended by a blackboard at a
                                    point. The solid angle \(\Omega\) is the area of the shaded region on the sphere,
                                    which is the blackboard's projection. We assume the sphere has a unit radius.
                                    Likewise, the next model illustrates how different objects subtend varying solid
                                    angles.

                                                    <strong>Pointed Cone (\(\theta = 0\)):</strong> When the semi-apex

                                                    Substituting \(\theta = 0\) into the formula yields \(\Omega = 0\),

                                    Electric flux measures the quantity of the electric field passing through a given
                                    surface. It quantifies how the electric field interacts with the surface and is a
                                    fundamental concept in understanding electric fields and their effects on various
                                    surfaces.

                                    For an infinitesimal surface \( d\vec{S} \) in an electric field \( \vec{E} \), the
                                    electric flux \( d\phi \) is given by:
                                </p>

                                    \(\qquad d\phi = \vec{E} \cdot d\vec{S} \)

                                    Here, \( d\vec{S} \) is a vector whose magnitude equals the infinitesimal area and
                                    whose direction is perpendicular to the surface, pointing outward. The dot product
                                    accounts for the angle between the electric field and the surface normal. The
                                    elctric flux can be positive, negative or zero and has an SI unit of

                                    To calculate the electric flux through a significant sized surface, we perform
                                    integration:

                                    If the electric field \( \vec{E} \) is uniform, the total electric flux \(
                                    \phi \) through the surface gets simplified as:
                                </p>

                                    Thus, we conclude for electric flux \(\phi\) through any general surface \(S\),

                                    In the above part (b) of 3D models, a set of small surfaces are considered. For
                                    different positions of small area \(\vec{ds}\) the flux is different. It can be
                                    observed that:

                                            when the electric field lines are entering the Gaussian surface,
                                            \(\vec{E}\) makes obtuse angle with \(\vec{ds}\). So,

                                            when the electric field lines are exiting the Gaussian surface,

                                            when the electric field lines are just tangential to the surface,
                                            \(\vec{E}\) makes right angle with \(\vec{ds}\). So,

                                <p>
                                    Thus the flux gives an idea of how much electric field lines are exiting from a
                                    closed surface. Entry of the electric field lines leads to negative and
                                    tangential electric field lines lead to zero flux at those spots.

                                    Also it is intuitive that:

                                            if no net charge is present within the closed surface, all electric field
                                            lines that enter the Gaussian surface (causing negative flux) should also
                                            come out of the Gaussian surface (causing positive flux). So, the total flux
                                            through the Gaussian surface will
                                            become zero:

                                    With the above understanding of total flux through a closed surface (Gaussian
                                    surface), let us first understand Gauss's law intuitively. Once we grasp the essence
                                    of this law, we will explore how it can be derived formally using fundamental

                                Through a closed surface, we can calculate the electric flux directly by using the
                                Gauss's law. But for an open surface we generally use either the symmtry principles or
                                solid angle concept to find the net electric flux. This is illustrated below:

                                                Consider a charge \( q \) placed at the center of a hemisphere of

                                                \( R \).
                                                The electric field lines emerging from the charge are radially

                                                and
                                                uniformly distributed in all directions. On the curved surface of

                                                leading to a
                                                straightforward flux calculation.

                                                will be

                                                Consider a point charge \( q \) placed at a distance \( x \) along the
                                                axis from the center of a disc of radius \( R \). The total electric
                                                flux emanating from the charge
                                                \( q \) is uniformly spread over all solid angles surrounding the
                                                charge. To find the flux through the disc, we calculate the fraction of
                                                the total solid angle subtended by the disc at the charge's position.

                                                the flux per unit solid angle is:

                                                Consider a spherically symmetric total charge \(Q\) distributed in a
                                                region around the origin of co-ordinates. Let the charge distribution be
                                                limited within a distance \(R\) from the origin. We will use the
                                                techniques of Gauss's law and symmetry to find the electric field at
                                                any general position \(r\) from the origin.

                                                from the origin, we consider a Gaussian surface (a closed surface)

                                                density. We use a cylinder-shaped Gaussian surface that straddles the

                                                faces parallel to the charged plane). By symmetry:

                                                Let the surface charge density be \(\sigma\). Then the charge enclosed

                                                is \(\sigma \times (\text{area of cylinder face})\). Applying Gauss's
