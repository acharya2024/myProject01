                                    Capacitance is a measure of a conductor's ability to store charge. So, when we refer
                                    to capacitance of a conductors, we call it capacitor. An isolated capacitor is a
                                    single conductor, or a system of conductors, in isolation from external influences.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    A capacitor can store energy in the form of potential energy in an electric field.
                                    In this chapter we'll discuss the capacity of conductors to hold charge and energy.

                                    When a conductor is charged, its potential increases. It is found that for an
                                    isolated conductor potential \(V\) of the conductor is proportional to
                                    charge \(Q\) given to it.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    \(\qquad V\propto Q\)

                                <p>
                                    The <strong>capacitance</strong> \(C\) of an isolated conductor is defined as the
                                    ratio of the charge \( Q \) stored on the
                                    conductor to the potential \( V \) of the conductor:
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    \(\qquad C = \dfrac{Q}{V} \)

                                <p>
                                    In other words, capacitance of an isolated conductor can be defined as charge
                                    required to increase
                                    potential of the conductor by unit volt.

                                <p>
                                    For an isolated conductor, the potential is determined relative to a reference
                                    point, often taken as infinity where the potential is assumed to be zero. Conductor
                                    should be of finite dimension, so that potential of
                                    infinity can be assumed to be zero.

                                    For
                                    example, for an isolated spherical conductor of radius \( R \) containing some
                                    charge \(Q\) at potential \(V\), the capacitance can be derived from the formula:
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    \(\qquad V = \dfrac{Q}{4\pi \epsilon_0 R }\)
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    \(\Rightarrow\quad C_\text{Spherical condcutor} = 4\pi \epsilon_0 R \)
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    This result shows that the capacitance of a spherical conductor is directly
                                    proportional to its radius and is independent of the charge or potential.

                                <h4>Work Done in Charging an Isolated Conductor</h4>
                                <p>
                                    Work is to be done by external agent in charging the conductor. This work by
                                    external agent gets stored in form of potential energy. This total energy stored in
                                    electric field of conductor is called self-energy of conductor.
                                    To find total work done by external agent, we will consider the total charge Q on
                                    the conductor is brought by external agent one by one in steps of dq and the process
                                    occurs very slowly. This is shown in following diagram:

                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    If a conductor has acquired a charge q, then work done by external agent in bringing
                                    further charge $dq$ from infinity on the conductor is:
                                    \[dW=\frac{q}{C}dq\]
                                    And to find total work \[W\] in charging the conductor to charge \[Q\] is,
                                    \[\int{dW=\int\limits_{0}^{Q}{\frac{q}{C}dq}}\,\]
                                    \[\Rightarrow W=\frac{{{Q}^{2}}}{2C}\]
                                    Thus energy stored in a conductor, having capacitance C and charge Q with final
                                    potential V is:
                                    \[U=\frac{{{Q}^{2}}}{2C}=\frac{1}{2}C{{V}^{2}}=\frac{QV}{2}\] [Using Q = CV]
                                    This self-energy is stored in the region of electric field due to the conductor.

                                    When two or more isolated conductors are connected by a conducting wire, they share
                                    charge until they
                                    reach the same potential. This redistribution depends on the initial charge and
                                    capacitance of the
                                    conductors.

                                    Consider two isolated conductors with capacitances \( C_1 \) and \( C_2 \),
                                    initially charged to
                                    potentials \( V_1 \) and \( V_2 \), respectively. Upon connection, charges
                                    redistribute, and the system
                                    reaches a common potential \( V_f \). Conservation of charge and the principle of
                                    equipotentiality lead
                                    to:

                                <p>
                                    When two conductors are connected, the redistribution of charge can result in the
                                    generation of heat due
                                    to resistive losses. The heat \( H \) generated is the difference between the
                                    initial energy of the
                                    system and the final energy:
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    \(\qquad H = \frac{1}{2} C_1 V_1^2 + \frac{1}{2} C_2 V_2^2 - \frac{1}{2} (C_1 + C_2)
                                    V_f^2 \)
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Substituting \( V_f \) from the earlier formula ensures conservation of energy in
                                    the system.
