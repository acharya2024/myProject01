                                    The concept of <strong>charge</strong> is fundamental in understanding the
                                    interactions of particles in the realm of electromagnetism. Much like mass is an
                                    intrinsic property that causes particles to experience gravitational forces, charge
                                    is a fundamental property that leads particles to experience electric and magnetic
                                    forces. The SI unit of charge is the coulomb (C). The charges are only known to
                                    occur on matterial objects, having finite mass.

                                    Charges come in two distinct types, often referred to as <strong>polarity</strong>:
                                    positive and negative. Particles with like charges repel each other, while those
                                    with unlike charges attract.

                                    The smallest stable quantity of charge known is the <strong>electronic
                                        charge</strong>, denoted as \( e \), which has a magnitude of approximately \(
                                    1.602 \times 10^{-19} \) coulombs. This unit is the charge carried by a single
                                    proton, with electrons carrying a charge of the same magnitude but opposite
                                    polarity. All observable charges are
                                    integral multiples of this elementary charge.

                                    When charges are distributed over a region of space, we describe this distribution
                                    using <strong>charge density</strong>. For linear distributions, we define a linear
                                    charge density \( \lambda \) as the charge per unit length. For surface
                                    distributions, the surface charge density \( \sigma \) represents the charge per
                                    unit area. In the case of volumetric distributions, the volume charge density \(
                                    \rho \) denotes the charge per unit volume. These densities help us analyze electric
                                    fields generated by continuous charge distributions.

                                        The force between two point charges is described by <strong>Coulomb's
                                            Law</strong>. This fundamental principle states that the magnitude of the
                                        electrostatic force \( F \) between two stationary point charges is directly
                                        proportional to the product of the absolute values of the charges and inversely
                                        proportional to the square of the distance \( r \) between them. Mathematically,
                                        it is expressed as:
                                    </p>

                                        \(\qquad F = k \dfrac{|q_1 q_2|}{r^2}\)
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        where \( k \) is Coulomb's constant (\( k = \dfrac{1}{4\pi\varepsilon_0} \)),
                                        and
                                        \( \varepsilon_0 \) is the vacuum permittivity. The scalar form of Coulomb's Law
                                        provides the magnitude of the force, while the direction is along the line
                                        connecting the two charges, being repulsive if the charges are of like signs and
                                        attractive if they are of opposite signs.

                                        An important principle in electrostatics is the <strong>principle of
                                            superposition of forces</strong>. This principle states that the total force
                                        acting on a charge due to multiple other charges is the vector sum of the
                                        individual forces exerted by each charge. Experimentally, it has been observed
                                        that when a charge \( q_0 \) is placed in the presence of several other charges
                                        \( q_1, q_2, \ldots \), the force exerted by each charge on \( q_0 \) remains
                                        unaffected by the presence of other charges in the surrounding. Therefore, the
                                        net force on \( q_0 \) is obtained by adding up all these individual forces
                                        vectorially.

                                        In other words, the principle of superposition states that the total force

                                    The electric field is a property of a point in space, determined by the influence of
                                    charges in its surroundings. For example, if a 2 C charge placed at point P
                                    experiences a force of 10 N along the x-axis due to nearby charges, replacing it
                                    with a 4 C charge would result in a force of 20 N in the same direction. This
                                    demonstrates that any charge placed at point P will experience a force of 5 N/C per
                                    unit charge. This value of 5 N/C is the electric field at point P, which is
                                    independent of the specific charge placed at P but depends entirely on the charges
                                    distributed around P.

                                    Mathematically, if a charge \( q \) is placed at a point in an electric field and
                                    experiences a net force \( \vec{F} \), the electric field strength at that point is
                                    given by:

                                    the test charge \( q_0 \) must be small enough to avoid altering the charge
                                    distribution of the source charges.

                                    various points and the relative strength of the field, indicating the force a

                                    To construct electric field lines, the direction of the electric field at multiple
                                    points in a region is first represented by small arrows, each pointing in the
                                    direction of the electric field. Connecting these arrows forms continuous lines,
                                    known as electric field lines, which provide a clear depiction of the field's
                                    behavior. The following diagram demonstrates this concept with examples:

                                                A uniformly charged ring exhibits unique electric field properties,
                                                depending on the location of the observation point. Below, we discuss
                                                two key scenarios: the electric field at the center of the ring and the
                                                electric field at a point along its axis.
                                            </p>

                                            <p><strong>1. Electric Field at the Center of the Ring:</strong></p>
                                            <p>
                                                At the center of a uniformly charged ring, the electric field is zero
                                                due to symmetry. Consider a small segment \( AB \) of the ring and its
                                                opposite segment \( CD \). The electric field produced by \( AB \) at
                                                the center is canceled out by the field produced by \( CD \), as shown
                                                in the diagram below. This cancellation occurs for all such opposite
                                                pairs, resulting in a net electric field strength of zero at the center.

                                                total charge \( Q \), which subtends an angle \( \theta \) at its center
                                                \( C \). The task is to calculate the electric field strength at \( C \)

                                                whether the sphere is a uniformly charged shell or a solid sphere.

                                                    sphere depends only on the charge enclosed within a smaller sphere

                                                    This result follows from symmetry and the fact that the electric
                                                    field inside a uniformly charged spherical shell is zero, as

                                                linearly within the sphere and decreases inversely with the square of
                                                the distance outside the sphere.
