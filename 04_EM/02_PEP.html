                                    Potential energy, in general, represents the ability of a system to do work due to
                                    its configuration. For any conservative force, potential energy is defined as the
                                    negative of the work done by that force. For example, if gravitational forces
                                    perform positive work during a process, the gravitational potential energy of the
                                    system decreases accordingly.

                                    Similarly, in the case of electrostatic forces, the change in electrostatic
                                    potential energy of a system of charges during a process is defined as the negative
                                    of the work done by electrostatic forces on the system. When charges are separated
                                    by infinite distances, their interactions become negligible, and the potential
                                    energy is conventionally set to zero. Thus, for any process:

                                                x \). To find the change potential energy of the system for a change in
                                                separation, we shall calculate the work done by electric field in the
