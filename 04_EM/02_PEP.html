                                    Potential energy, in general, represents the ability of a system to do work due to
                                    its configuration. For any conservative force, potential energy is defined as the
                                    negative of the work done by that force. For example, if gravitational forces
                                    perform positive work during a process, the gravitational potential energy of the
                                    system decreases accordingly.

                                    Similarly, in the case of electrostatic forces, the change in electrostatic
                                    potential energy of a system of charges during a process is defined as the negative
                                    of the work done by electrostatic forces on the system. When charges are separated
                                    by infinite distances, their interactions become negligible, and the potential
                                    energy is conventionally set to zero. Thus, for any process:

                                                x \). To find the change potential energy of the system for a change in
                                                separation, we shall calculate the work done by electric field in the

                                                systems, we can extend our analysis to systems containing multiple
                                                charges. Understanding the potential energy in a many-particle system

                                    The principle of conservation of mechanical energy states that in the absence of
                                    dissipative forces (like friction or air resistance), the total mechanical energy
                                    (kinetic energy + potential energy) of a system remains constant throughout its

                                    In a system where only one charge moves while the others remain fixed, the system's
                                    potential energy changes solely due to the interactions involving the moving charge.
                                    These interactions are often simplified and referred to as the "potential energy of
                                    the particle." However, it is crucial to recognize that potential energy is
                                    inherently a property of the entire system's interactions, not just a single

                                                A uniformly charged ring has a total charge \( Q \) and radius \( R \).
                                                A point charge \( q \) is placed at the center of the ring. Determine
                                                the electrostatic potential energy of the point charge due to the ring.

                                                charge \( q \) placed at the center of a uniformly charged ring, we
                                                first calculate the potential energy \(dU\) of \(q\) with an
                                                elemental charge \(dQ\) on the ring. Then we perform integration to get
                                                total potential energy of \(q\). Thus,

                                                Therefore, the potential energy of the point charge \( q \) at the

                                    Previously, we defined the potential energy of a charged particle at a point as the
                                    negative of the work done by an electric field in bringing a unit positive charge
                                    from infinity to that location. Building on this concept, the electrostatic
                                    potential at a point is defined as the potential energy per unit charge of a
                                    particle placed there. In other words,
                                </p>

                                    The electrostatic potential at a point is the negative of the work done by the

                                    Therefore, electrostatic potential is a property of a specific location in space
                                    that represents the potential energy per unit charge a charge would have if placed
                                    at that point. This means that the electrostatic potential quantifies how much
                                    potential energy is available to a charge at a given position within an electric
                                    field.

                                    The electrostatic potential \( V \) at a point located at a distance \( r \) from a

                                    The potential is positive if the point charge \( Q \) is positive, indicating that
                                    work must be done against the electric field to bring a positive test charge closer
                                    to \( Q \). Conversely, the potential is negative if \( Q \) is negative, meaning
                                    that work is done by the electric field when bringing a positive test charge closer.

                                    We observe here that the electrostatic potential \( V \) is a scalar quantity
                                    having SI unit of Joule/Coulomb, often written as Volt (V). To find potential at a
                                    point \(P\) due to a set of charges\( q_1, q_2, \ldots, q_n \), we calculate the
                                    potential due to each charge and perform the scalar sum. For contineous charge
                                    distributions, we require integration methods to know the potential at a point.

                                    For continuous charge distributions, the potential at a point is obtained by
                                    integrating over the entire charge distribution. If the charge distribution is
                                    characterized by a linear charge density \( \lambda \), surface charge density \(
                                    \sigma \), or volume charge density \( \rho \), the potential is given by:

                                    given by \( V = \frac{1}{4\pi \varepsilon_0} \frac{q}{r} \). This means that the

                                            the electric field is related to the change in potential energy (\( W =
                                            -\Delta U \)), the work done by the electric
                                            field is zero for any displacement along the equipotential surface. This is
                                            only possible if the electric force on
                                            the charge is perpendicular to its displacement. Consequently, electric
                                            field lines are always perpendicular to
                                            equipotential surfaces.

                                        The equipotential surfaces are symmetrically arranged, with higher potentials
                                        near the charges. At points closer
                                        to either charge, the surfaces bend around the charge, while at larger
                                        distances, the surfaces appear circular.

                                        along the dipole axis. The potential in this region transitions from positive to

                                                The electric field \( \vec{E} \) at any point is related to the

                                                Mathematically, this relationship is expressed as:

                                                For a one-dimensional case, where the potential varies only along the \(

                                                The negative sign indicates that the electric field points in the
