                                    Potential energy, in general, represents the ability of a system to do work due to
                                    its configuration. For any conservative force, potential energy is defined as the
                                    negative of the work done by that force. For example, if gravitational forces
                                    perform positive work during a process, the gravitational potential energy of the
                                    system decreases accordingly.

                                    Similarly, in the case of electrostatic forces, the change in electrostatic
                                    potential energy of a system of charges during a process is defined as the negative
                                    of the work done by electrostatic forces on the system. When charges are separated
                                    by infinite distances, their interactions become negligible, and the potential
                                    energy is conventionally set to zero. Thus, for any process:

                                                x \). To find the change potential energy of the system for a change in
                                                separation, we shall calculate the work done by electric field in the

                                                systems, we can extend our analysis to systems containing multiple
                                                charges. Understanding the potential energy in a many-particle system

                                    The principle of conservation of mechanical energy states that in the absence of
                                    dissipative forces (like friction or air resistance), the total mechanical energy
                                    (kinetic energy + potential energy) of a system remains constant throughout its

                                    In a system where only one charge moves while the others remain fixed, the system's
                                    potential energy changes solely due to the interactions involving the moving charge.
                                    These interactions are often simplified and referred to as the "potential energy of
                                    the particle." However, it is crucial to recognize that potential energy is
                                    inherently a property of the entire system's interactions, not just a single
                                    particle.

                                                A uniformly charged ring has a total charge \( Q \) and radius \( R \).

                                                the electrostatic potential energy of the point charge due to the ring.

                                                To calculate the electrostatic potential energy \( U \) of the point
                                                charge \( q \) placed at the center of a uniformly charged ring, we
                                                first calculate the potential energy \(dU\) of \(q\) with an
                                                elemental charge \(dQ\) on the ring. Then we perform integration to get
                                                total potential energy of \(q\). Thus,

                                            <p>
                                                \(\qquad dU=k\dfrac{qdQ}{R})

                                                Therefore, the potential energy of the point charge \( q \) at the

                                    Previously, we defined the potential energy of a charged particle at a point as the
                                    negative of the work done by an electric field in bringing a unit positive charge
                                    from infinity to that location. Building on this concept, the electrostatic
                                    potential at a point is defined as the potential energy per unit charge of a
                                    particle placed there. In other words,
                                </p>

                                    The electrostatic potential at a point is the negative of the work done by the

                                    Therefore, electrostatic potential is a property of a specific location in space
                                    that represents the potential energy per unit charge a charge would have if placed
                                    at that point. This means that the electrostatic potential quantifies how much
                                    potential energy is available to a charge at a given position within an electric
                                    field.

                                    The electrostatic potential \( V \) at a point located at a distance \( r \) from a

                                    The potential is positive if the point charge \( Q \) is positive, indicating that
                                    work must be done against the electric field to bring a positive test charge closer
                                    to \( Q \). Conversely, the potential is negative if \( Q \) is negative, meaning
                                    that work is done by the electric field when bringing a positive test charge closer.

                                    We observe here that the electrostatic potential \( V \) is a scalar quantity
                                    having SI unit of Joule/Coulomb, often written as Volt (V). To find potential at a
                                    point \(P\) due to a set of charges\( q_1, q_2, \ldots, q_n \), we calculate the
                                    potential due to each charge and perform the scalar sum. For contineous charge
                                    distributions, we require integration methods to know the potential at a point.

                                    For continuous charge distributions, the potential at a point is obtained by
                                    integrating over the entire charge distribution. If the charge distribution is
                                    characterized by a linear charge density \( \lambda \), surface charge density \(
                                    \sigma \), or volume charge density \( \rho \), the potential is given by:

                                    where \( dq \) is the infinitesimal charge element. These results are used for
                                    deriving some standard results of electrostatic potential due to different charge

                                    Equipotential surfaces are imaginary surfaces in space where the electric
                                    potential is the same at every point.

                                    For example, in the case of a point charge \( q \), the electric potential at a
                                    distance \( r \) from the charge is given by \( V = \dfrac{1}{4\pi \varepsilon_0}
                                    \dfrac{q}{r} \). This means that the potential depends only on the
                                    radial distance \( r \), and must remain constant on a sphere centered at the
                                    charge. As a result, equipotential surfaces are concentric spheres centered on the

                                        Equipotential surfaces provide valuable insight into the relationship between
                                        electrostatic forces, electric field lines, and potential energy. Let us

                                            Since potential at a point represents potential energy per unit charge, the
                                            potential energy of the charge remains constant when it moves along the
                                            equipotential surface. This is because the potential does not vary across
                                            the surface.

                                            The work done by electrostatic forces is zero. If any work were done, the
                                            electrostatic potential energy of the system would change, which contradicts

                                            Electric field lines are always perpendicular to equipotential surfaces. If
                                            electric field lines were not perpendicular, there would be a component of
                                            the electric field along the surface, resulting in non-zero work done by
                                            electrostatic forces. This violates the fundamental property of
                                            equipotential surfaces.

                                    Thus, if in a given region, electric field lines are drawn we can find a surface

                                    If a positive charge is released in an electric field, it will naturally start to
                                    travel
                                    along the field lines with increasing kinetic energy and decreasing potential
                                    energy. This implies that the potential energy of a positive charge decreases in the
                                    direction of the electric field. Since potential is defined as potential energy per
                                    unit charge, the potential must also decrease along the direction of the electric
                                    field.
                                </p>

                                    Furthermore, the electric field must always be perpendicular to equipotential
                                    surfaces. If the field were not perpendicular, moving a charge along the
                                    equipotential surface would result in work being done, which contradicts the
                                    definition of equipotential surfaces. This perpendicularity ensures that the
                                    electric field represents the direction of the steepest potential decrease. Hence,

                                    If the electric field in a region is known, the potential difference between any two
                                    points in that region is uniquely determined. This relationship arises from the
                                    connection between electrostatic force and electrostatic potential energy, which
                                    allows us to relate the electric field to the potential. The relationship is
                                    expressed as follows:
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The change in electrostatic potential energy \( \Delta U \) for moving a charge \( q
                                    \) from point \( A \) to point \( B \) in the presence of an electric field \(
                                    \vec{E} \) along a path \( \vec{ds} \) is given by:
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    \(\qquad dU = -\left(q\vec{E} \cdot \vec{ds}\right)\)
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Dividing through by \( q \), we find the change in potential \( \Delta V \) between
                                    points \( A \) and \( B \) as:
                                </p>
                                <p class="text-center text-law">
                                    \( \Delta V = -\displaystyle\int_A^B \left(\vec{E} \cdot \vec{ds}\right)\)

                                    This equation states that the potential difference between two points is the
                                    negative line integral of the electric field along any path connecting those points.
                                </p>

                                    Conversely, if the electrostatic potential \( V \) is known as a function of
                                    position in space, the electric field \( \vec{E} \) can be determined by
                                    differentiation. Let’s derive this step by step.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Consider a charge \( q \) being displaced along the \( x \)-axis by a small distance
                                    \( dx \). The negative of the work done by the electrostatic force gives the change
                                    in potential energy:
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    \(\qquad dU = -\left(q\vec{E} \cdot \vec{ds}\right)\)
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    During the displacement, the \( y \)- and \( z \)-coordinates remain constant, so \(
                                    \vec{ds} = dx\hat{i} \). Substituting this:
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    \(\qquad dU = -\left(q(E_x\hat{i} + E_y\hat{j} + E_z\hat{k}) \cdot
                                    dx\hat{i}\right)\)
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Simplifying, since only the \( x \)-component contributes:
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    \(\qquad dU = -qE_x dx\)
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    \(\Rightarrow\quad dV = -E_x dx\)
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    \(\Rightarrow\quad E_x=-\dfrac{dV}{dx}\)
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The expression \( dV = -E_x dx\) relates the infinitesimal change in potential
                                    \( dV \) to the electric field component along the \( x \)-axis: \( E_x \), and a
                                    small displacement \( dx \) along the \( x \)-axis. Also this relation is based on
                                    the assumption that \(y\) and \(z\) co-ordinates of the particle remain unchanged.
                                    Thus,
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    \(\Rightarrow\quad E_x=-\left(\dfrac{dV}{dx}\right)_{y,z\to \text{constant}}\)
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Another mathematical way to write the same expression is:
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    \(\qquad \quad E_x=-\dfrac{\partial V}{\partial x}\)
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The partial derivative \( \dfrac{\partial V}{\partial x} \) simply means we are
                                    calculating how the potential \( V \) changes when we vary only \( x \).

                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Similarly, considering displacements along the \( y \)- and \( z \)-axes, we derive:
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    \(\qquad E_y = -\dfrac{\partial V}{\partial y}, \quad E_z = -\dfrac{\partial
                                    V}{\partial z}\)
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Combining all components, the electric field is expressed in vector form as:
                                </p>
                                <p class="text-center text-law">
                                    \(\vec{E} = -\left(\dfrac{\partial V}{\partial x}\hat{i} +

                                                Consider the electric field inside a uniformly charged hollow sphere. By
                                                symmetry, the electric field inside the sphere is zero at every point.
                                                As a result, the potential inside the sphere is constant because there
                                                is no field to create a potential difference between any two points.

                                                This constant potential equals the potential at the surface of the
                                                sphere, which is calculated as:

                                                Here, \( Q \) is the total charge on the sphere, and \( R \) is its
                                                radius. Since the electric field is zero inside, the potential remains
                                                uniform and unaffected by changes in position within the sphere.

                                                Consider a uniformly charged infinite plane sheet, which creates a
                                                constant electric field \( E \) perpendicular to its surface. The
                                                potential difference \( \Delta V \) between two points at distances \(
                                                x_1 \) and \( x_2 \) from the sheet is given by:
                                            </p>
                                            <p>

                                            <p>
                                                This result follows directly from the relationship \( \Delta V = -\int
                                                \vec{E} \cdot \vec{ds} \), where the electric field is constant and
                                                parallel to the displacement vector.
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                Thus, the potential decreases linearly as we move away from the sheet,
                                                with the direction of decrease being in the direction of the
