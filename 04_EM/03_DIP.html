                                    We study about such electric dipoles because they can
                                    interact with external electric fields and also generate their own electric fields.
                                    In this section, we will systematically study the effects experienced by and
                                    produced by electric dipoles.

                                    The strength of an electric dipole is measured by its dipole moment. For an electric
                                    dipole consisting of two equal and opposite charges \( +q \) and \( -q \), separated
                                    by a displacement \( \vec{l} \), the dipole moment \( \vec{p} \) is defined as:
                                </p>
                                <p>

                                <p>
                                    The displacement \( \vec{l} \) is measured from the negative charge to the positive
                                    charge. The dipole moment of an electric dipole is a vector quantity and has an SI
                                    unit of Coulomb meter \(\left(\text{Cm}\right)\).

                                    position \( \vec{r}_2 \), this general definition simplifies to:
                                </p>
                                <p>

                                    which points from the negative charge to the positive charge, as mentioned earlier.

                                                    This matches the result we obtained using the first method. Thus,

                                                and the field. It tries to rotate the dipole so that

                                                Also, importantly, the net torque on the dipole is the
                                                same

                                    Consider an electric dipole placed in a uniform electric field \(\vec{E}\).
                                    As we have seen, the dipole experiences no net translational force in a uniform
                                    field,
                                    but it can experience a torque that tends to align its dipole moment \(\vec{p}\)
                                    with \(\vec{E}\).
                                </p>

                                    The potential energy of the dipole in the electric field is defined in terms of the
                                    work
                                    done against the electric field’s torque to change the dipole’s orientation. We
                                    choose
                                    the configuration where the dipole is oriented at \(90^\circ\) to the field as our
                                    reference
                                    point of zero potential energy. This choice is a matter of convenience and does not
                                    affect
                                    the physics, only the zero point of energy.

                                    Suppose the dipole initially makes an angle \(\theta_1\) with the electric field
                                    \(\vec{E}\).
                                    We now rotate it slowly to another angle \(\theta_2\), ensuring that it moves
                                    quasi-statically
                                    (without gaining kinetic energy). To do this, an external agent must apply a torque
                                    equal
                                    and opposite to the field’s torque.

                                    If we take \(\theta=90^\circ\) as our zero potential energy configuration, then at
                                    \(\theta=90^\circ\),
                                    \(\cos(90^\circ)=0\). Measuring potential energy relative to this orientation, the

                                    Using the dot product \(\vec{p}\cdot\vec{E} = pE\cos\theta\), we can write:
                                </p>

                                    We can arrive at the same expression by considering the electric potential at the
                                    positions
                                    of the two charges comprising the dipole. Suppose the dipole consists of a positive
                                    charge
                                    \(+q\) and a negative charge \(-q\) separated by a distance \(2a\). The total
                                    potential energy
                                    of the dipole in the external field is the sum of the energies of each charge in the
                                    field’s
                                    potential.

                                <p>
                                    When the dipole is oriented at \(90^\circ\) to the field, the positive and negative
                                    charges lie
                                    on the same equipotential surface, making the net potential energy zero. As you
                                    rotate the
                                    dipole away from \(90^\circ\), one charge moves to a region of higher potential and
                                    the other
                                    to a region of lower potential, resulting in a net potential energy that matches the
                                    earlier
                                    derived expression \(-pE\cos\theta\).

                                    The dipole is considered a rigid object: the distance between the charges does not
                                    change.
                                    Therefore, the internal electrostatic energy due to the interaction between the +q
                                    and -q
                                    charges remains constant. We do not consider this internal energy when discussing
                                    the
                                    potential energy in the external field, as it does not vary during the rotation
                                    process.

                                    These distances are found by projecting the dipole axis onto the line from \(O\) to

                                    leads to a factor
                                    involving \(\cos\theta\) and \(d\). After simplification, the dominant term emerges
                                    as:

                                    Recognizing that \(p = q d\), we get the final expression for the potential of a
                                    dipole at a far point \(P\):

                                    This result shows that the potential due to a dipole decreases faster with distance
                                    (\(1/r^2\)) than that of a single charge (\(1/r\)).
                                    The factor \(\cos\theta\) indicates that the potential depends on the orientation of
                                    the dipole relative to the observation point.
                                    Along the axis of the dipole (\(\theta = 0^\circ\)), the potential is maximum, and
                                    at the equatorial line (\(\theta = 90^\circ\)), the potential is zero.
