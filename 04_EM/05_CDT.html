                                            </summary>
                                            <p> Imagine a conductor initially placed in a region with no external
                                                electric field. In this case, the free charges within the
                                                conductor—typically electrons in metals—are uniformly distributed, and
                                                there is no electric field inside the conductor. The first diagram
                                                illustrates this state of equilibrium, where all charges are stationary,
                                                and no forces act on them. </p> DIAGRAM HERE <p> Now, when an external
                                                electric field is switched on, the free charges in the conductor respond
                                                immediately. Electrons move opposite to the direction of the applied
                                                field, while positive charges (if present, such as in electrolytes)
                                                shift in the direction of the field. This movement creates a charge
                                                separation within the conductor, resulting in negative charges
                                                accumulating on one side and positive charges on the opposite side of
                                                the conductor. The second diagram depicts this transient state, where
                                                charges are actively redistributing in response to the applied field.
                                            </p> DIAGRAM HERE <p> As this redistribution continues, the surface charges
                                                on the conductor generate their own electric field. This induced field
                                                opposes the external field within the conductor. The process of charge
                                                movement and redistribution continues until the induced field completely
                                                cancels the external field inside the conductor. At this point, the
                                                electric field within the conductor becomes zero, reaching electrostatic
                                                equilibrium. The final diagram shows the steady state where the field
                                                inside the conductor is null, and no further charge movement occurs.

                                                being done on it. Thus potential energy of this test charge will remain
                                                constant during the motion. In terms of potential (potential energy per

                                            <p> The net or excess charge on a conductor always resides entirely on its

                                                through both physical intuition and mathematical reasoning. </p>
                                            <p> Initially, consider a conductor with no external electric field. In this

                                                redistribute themselves. The first diagram illustrates this process,

                                                    <p> The redistribution of charges occurs because like charges repel
                                                        each other. In a conductor, where charges are free to move, they
                                                        naturally spread out to maximize their distance from one
                                                        another. The farthest distance they can achieve is by moving to
                                                        the outer surface of the conductor. </p> DIAGRAM HERE

                                                    <p> To further understand, consider a hypothetical closed Gaussian
                                                        surface drawn entirely within the conductor's interior. Since
                                                        the electric field inside a conductor is zero, the electric flux
                                                        through any elemental surface of this Gaussian surface must also
                                                        be zero. This leads to total flux also to be zero. </p>

                                                The inner face is in the region where the field is zero, and the outer
                                                face is exposed to the field \( \vec{E} \). The curved surface of the

                                                charges—typically electrons—immediately respond by moving. Negative
                                                charges shift in one direction, and positive charges (if present) shift

                                            <p> A fascinating scenario arises when a conductor contains a cavity. If a

                                                opposite charge \(-q\) on the inner surface of the cavity. This occurs
                                                because the electric field inside the conductor's material must remain

                                                flux through the Gaussian surface is also zero. Thus, the total charge

                                    internal cavities, the guiding principle remains the same: the electric field within
                                    the conductor becomes zero, and charges redistribute to satisfy this condition while
                                    conserving charge. </p>

                                <p> Conducting surfaces experience forces due to the repulsion of charges distributed
                                    over them. These forces arise from the electric field created by surface charges and
                                    are crucial for understanding electrostatic pressure and the mechanical stresses
                                    acting on conductors. </p>
                                <p> To better understand this phenomenon, let us analyze the situation by naming the
                                    surfaces and charges involved. </p>
                                <p> Consider a flat surface \( S \) with a uniform surface charge density \( \sigma \).
                                    The electric field generated by this surface at a nearby point is given by: </p>
                                <p> \(\qquad E = \dfrac{\sigma}{2\epsilon_0} \) </p>
                                <p> This field is directed outward on either side of \( S \), but in opposite directions
                                    due to symmetry. </p>
                                <p> Now, let us examine a conducting surface \( S_C \) with surface charge density \(
                                    \sigma \). For this conductor, the electric field just outside the surface is: </p>
                                <p> \(\qquad E = \dfrac{\sigma}{\epsilon_0} \) </p>
                                <p> directed perpendicular to the surface. </p>
                                <p> <strong>Why is the electric field outside a conducting surface equal to \(
                                        \dfrac{\sigma}{\epsilon_0} \) and not \( \dfrac{\sigma}{2\epsilon_0}
                                        \)?</strong> </p>
                                <p> To understand this, consider a small surface element \( \mathrm{d}S \) on the
                                    conductor \( S_C \), carrying a local surface charge density \( \sigma \). The
                                    electric field produced by \( \mathrm{d}S \) alone is: </p>
                                <p> \(\qquad E_{\mathrm{d}S} = \dfrac{\sigma}{2\epsilon_0} \) </p>
                                <p> This field is directed outward just outside the conductor and inward just inside.
                                    However, the charges on the rest of the conductor (other than those on \(
                                    \mathrm{d}S \)) also contribute to the total electric field. Their resulting effect
                                    is as follows: </p>
                                <ul>
                                    <li>
                                        <p> <strong>Inside the conductor:</strong> The additional electric field from
                                            the rest of the charges cancels the inward field produced by \( \mathrm{d}S
                                            \), ensuring that the net electric field inside \( S_C \) is zero. </p>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>
                                        <p> <strong>Outside the conductor:</strong> The contributions from the rest of
                                            the charges reinforce the outward field from \( \mathrm{d}S \), doubling it
                                            to: </p>
                                        <p> \(\qquad E = \dfrac{\sigma}{\epsilon_0} \) </p>
                                    </li>
                                </ul>
                                <p> Thus, the electric field just outside the conductor is \( \dfrac{\sigma}{\epsilon_0}
                                    \). This can be understood as: </p>
                                <p class="text-center text-law"> Half of the resulting electric field outside the
                                    conductor is generated by the charges on the immediate neighboring surface, while
                                    the other half is contributed by the charges distributed over the rest of the
                                    conducting surface. </p>
                                <p> <strong>Force on a Small Surface Element:</strong> The force on \( \mathrm{d}S \)
                                    arises from the interaction of the charges on \( \mathrm{d}S \) with the field
                                    created by the rest of the conductor. If the local charge density at the location of
                                    \( \mathrm{d}S \) is \( \sigma \), the electric field at \( \mathrm{d}S_C \) due to
                                    the rest of the charges (other than charges on \( \mathrm{d}S \)) will be: </p>
                                <p> \(\qquad E_{\text{rest}} = \dfrac{\sigma}{2\epsilon_0} \) </p>
                                <p> Thus, the force is: </p>
                                <p> \(\qquad \mathrm{d}F = \left(q_\mathrm{dS}\right) E_{\text{rest}} \) </p>
                                <p> \(\Rightarrow\quad \mathrm{d}F = \sigma \left(\mathrm{d}S_C
                                    \right)\dfrac{\sigma}{2\epsilon_0} \) </p>
                                <p> \(\Rightarrow\quad \mathrm{d}F = \dfrac{\sigma^2}{2\epsilon_0} \left(\mathrm{d}S_C
                                    \right)\) </p>
                                <p> This force acts perpendicular to \( \mathrm{d}S_C \), as the electric field \(
                                    E_{\text{rest}} \) was directed perpendicular to the surface \( \mathrm{d}S \). </p>
                                <p> <strong>Electrostatic Pressure:</strong> The force per unit area, or pressure, is
                                    given by: </p>
                                <p> \(\qquad P = \dfrac{\mathrm{d}F}{\mathrm{d}S_C} = \dfrac{\sigma^2}{2\epsilon_0} \)
                                </p>
                                <p> This result shows that the pressure on the conducting surface increases with the
                                    square of the local surface charge density \( \sigma \). It applies equally to
                                    positive and negative charges since the pressure depends only on \( \sigma^2 \).
                                    Thus, we conclude: </p>
                                <p class="text-center text-law"> For any small part of a conducting surface with local
                                    surface charge density \( \sigma \), it experiences a perpendicular outward force of
                                    \( \dfrac{\sigma^2}{2\epsilon_0} \) per unit area. </p>

                                <p> Conductors have boundaries up to which their free charges can move. When two
                                    conductors are connected, their boundaries effectively merge, and they behave as a
                                    single conductor. All the rules governing conductors now apply to the combined

                                            and at the other end is \( V_2 \). This potential difference (and hence the

                                        </ul>
                                        <p> Thus, connecting two conductors through a wire leads to a redistribution of
                                            charge until a common potential is achieved. </p>
                                        <p> During this process, the flow of charge in the connecting wire generates
                                            heat due to resistance, leading to energy dissipation. This dissipation
                                            corresponds to a decrease in the potential energy of the system. After
                                            redistribution, the charges are in a more stable, less repulsive state, and
                                            the system's potential energy is reduced. </p>

                                    This property arises because:

                                    Additionally, the Earth's enormous size makes it capable of absorbing or

                                    without significantly altering its potential. Using the formula for the

                                    Earthing, also known as grounding, is the process of connecting a

                                    conductive layers through a rod or conductor driven into the ground.
                                    This ensures effective charge transfer

                                    <strong>How Earthing Works:</strong>
                                    Suppose a charged conductor is connected to the Earth using a conducting
                                    wire. For clarity, consider the
                                    conductor to be isolated, so any positive charge on it would result in a
                                    positive potential, and similarly,
                                    a negative charge would result in a negative potential.
                                    - If the conductor is positively charged, electrons from the Earth flow
                                    into the conductor to neutralize
                                    the excess positive charge.
                                    - Conversely, if the conductor is negatively charged, excess electrons
                                    from the conductor flow into the
                                    Earth.
                                    This movement of charges continues until the potential of the conductor
                                    matches the Earth's potential,
                                    i.e., zero.

                                    Electrostatic shielding is the phenomenon where the interior of a conductor is

                                    in a conductor under electrostatic equilibrium, where the electric field within the

                                    external charge.
                                    Surface charges rearrange themselves in response to the external charge to cancel
                                    the field inside
                                    the cavity.
