## Photoelectric Effect
### Introduction [accordion item]
    - History para (Dont mention this as heading)
        - Quote that Michelson said, no new discoveries possible in physics any more. 
        - The year in which PEE was observed and explained. Scientists behid it. This marks the beginning of modern physics.
        - This marks the fundamental understanding of the light.
    - The Photoelectric Effect
        - Mention if electron somehow comes out of a metallic surface, the positively charged plate has a tendency to pull them back. So a finite amount of energy, the electrons must have to get ejected.
        - Define work function. Give suitable examples to understand the range of its values in Joules.
        - Mention about the new unit eV for energy and define is well using acceleration of electron through a potential difference. Mention previous example work function in terms of eV.
        - Mention the ways in which electrons can come out of a metallic surface (Refer description of NCERT Book)
        - Mention about Photoelectric Effect
        - Mention that it happens very commonly around us, but is difficult to observe. The ejected electrons get lost in air.
        - Hence we require an experimental set up to observe it.
### Experimental setup [accordion item]
    - We start with a diagram in which a metallic plate is shown on which falls the radiation. Electrons get lost. So we need vacuum.
    - Now another diagram with vacuum champber with electron emitting plate and electron receiving plate.
    - Mention about new problem that after sufficient number of emission of electrons, the emitter plate gets positively charged and stops emitting the electrons further.
    - Mention to solve this problem, we need to put the ejected electrons back to the emitter plate. This is done by connecting the collecting plate with emitter plate with conducting wire. 
    - this wire has a very sensitive ammeter. Now PEE can be sustained and observed. Use a new final diagram.
    - Ammeter reading is the evidence of occurance of PEE.
    - Mention definitions of photoelectrons and the photocurrent
    - Mention the scientist who took the observation. And its given in next section.
### Observations[accordion item]
    - A lot of observations were taken to understand about light behavior.
    - Observations with intensities [inside details-summary tag]
        - Mention how intensity was varied
        - Mention its impact on photocurrent
        - Mention the meaning variation in photocurrent. And clearify that it doesn't mean the speed of photoelectrons have increased. 
        - Use suitable examples like suppose 10 buses leave from city A to city B. If roads are made good, bus will take less time to go. But number of buses will remain the same.
        - Correlate it with speed doesn't affect the current
    - Observations with accelerating voltage[inside details-summary tag]
        - Talk about appling force on the ejected photoelectrons as they are travelling from one plate to other.
        - As they travel, electric field will apply force on them. For that a battery can be used in the circuit. Mention about the diagram representing this.
        - The effect of it: photocurrent increases slightly and then becomes constant.
        - Explain the meaning of it.
        - Actually electrons were all emitted with different speeds. Some were slow, hence were causing the traffick jam type of phenomena in between the plates (electron cloud etc)
        - Hence, few newly ejected electrons got repelled by the electron cloud and returned back to the emitter plate. These returning electrons were although photoelectrons but didn't get measured from ammeter
        - By applying sufficient accelerating voltage (the electric field) the cloud vanished and all electrons are now reaching the target.
        - This is the saturation state. Hence define the saturation current.
        - Mention about the previous intensity observation that it meant about the saturation current only.
        - Conclude that accelerating voltage leads to increment in current and constant. This proves, electrons are emitted with different speeds.
    - Observations with retarding voltage[inside details-summary tag]
        - Forces will be applied on photoelectrons in reverse direction to its motion.
        - Mention the observation to be also shown in graph.
        - Small retarding voltage will return back the less kinetic energetic electrons, decreasing the photocurrent.
        - Sufficient retarding voltage stops the even most energetic electron and current becomes zero.
        - It means that there was a limit on maximum kinetic energy of ejected electrons.
        - Define stopping potential and its relation with K maxi
    - Observations with frequency variation[inside details-summary tag]
        - Mention meaning of variation of frequency. It means chaning the colour.
        - Below certain frequency no electron was emitted. Whatsoever be the intensity [emphasize on it well].
        - Define threshold frequency and wavelength
        - with increase in intensity stopping potential varied. Mention a graph for its variation.
        - Mention meaning of such variation. It means, speed (or energy ) of individual electrons were affected by the frequency of radiation used.
    Observations with stopping potential[inside details-summary tag]
        - Mention we described that it depends on frequency.
        - Mention it was independent on intensity of light used
    - Observation with different metallic surface[inside details-summary tag]
        - Different metals have different work functions.
        - For a given frequency, electrons had different stopping potential. So different threshold frequencies.

    - Intensity problem: 
        - K max is independent of intensity
    - Frequency problem:
        - Below certain frequency no electron emission
    - Time lag problem:
        - Process is instantaneous
    - Conclusions:
        - Energy of radiation as we know (till that time) is not incident on the surface same way. There is something special about energy of radiation incident on the surface.
        - Mention energy is depending on more on frequency and less on brightness (intensity) of light.
### Einstein's explanation[accordion item]

## Particle nature of radiation: The photon
### Concept of photon [Accordion-item]
    - When radiation interacts with matter, it behaves as in descrete packats. Each packet is photon.
    - when radiation interacts with matter, energy exchange takes place in packets. In a single even of energy exchange, exactly one packet is exchanged. This packet is photon.
    - Mass of photon
        - Mass is an inertial property of matter, which checks how difficult it is to change the velocity. In a given medium, speed of light doesn't change. So previously understood concept of mass is not applicable here. So mass of photon is not defined.
        - However its rest mass can be considered zero. Mention logic behind it.
### Photon as energy and momentum carrier[Accordion-item]
    - Experimently, light gets generated from moving charges.... continues to propagate.... and if interacts with charged particles, causes charged particles to start moving. Thus we can say light carries energy and momentum with themselves.
    - Energy of photon        
        - Light can exchange energy with any other system only in descrete packets. Called Photon. One photon once formed, ca
        - Energy of photon and the logic established from PEE (the relation with frequency). 
        - The formula E=hf, has LHS as particle property of radiation, while RHS has wave property of radiation. So radiation itself is regarding dual nature of radiation.
        - Estimation of number of photon emitted by source: Explain how to calculate it if power and wavelength is given.
        - Estimation of number density of photons in given beam
    - Momentum of a photon        
        - De Broglie hypothesis in detail. Highest precision in concepts expected.
        - Mention formula.
        - Mention meaning of forumla
            - The photon was explained as momentum carrier. High momentum carriers have high frequency and less wavelength
            - E=h/lambda: has one side as momentum of one photon (particle behavior) and other side wavelength (wave behavior). Thus equation shows dual nature of light in itself.
### Radiation force and pressure[Accordion-item]
    - Force by photon on a perfectly absorbing surface 
        - with surface perpendicular to beam of light
        - with surface at any angle
        - with surface being curved and of any shape (explain about projection of area and calculation of force)
    - Assume surface is perfectly reflecting in nature, 
        - surface perpendicular
        - surface at general angle theta
        - Force on a sphere placed in path of beam of light (derive the result using integration of any other analytical method)
