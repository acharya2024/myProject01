                                    The Rutherford model of the atom was proposed by Ernest Rutherford in 1911, based on
                                    his famous gold foil experiment. This model describes the atom as having a small,
                                    dense, positively charged nucleus at its center, with electrons orbiting around it.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    To investigate the structure of the atom, Rutherford and his colleagues directed a
                                    beam of <strong>alpha particles</strong> at a very thin sheet of gold foil. Alpha
                                    particles are helium nuclei consisting of two protons and two neutrons, symbolized
                                    as \( \alpha \) particles. They are positively charged and possess significant
                                    kinetic energy, making them suitable probes for exploring atomic structure.

                                    In the experimental setup, a radioactive source emitted alpha particles, which were
                                    collimated into a narrow beam and directed at the gold foil target. A fluorescent
                                    screen or detector surrounded the foil to observe the scattering of alpha particles.

                                    As the alpha particles passed through the gold foil, most of them experienced little
                                    to no deflection, indicating that atoms are mostly empty space. However, a small
                                    fraction of alpha particles were deflected at large angles, and some even bounced
                                    back toward the source. This surprising result suggested that a tiny, dense,
                                    positively charged nucleus resides at the center of the atom.

                                    To quantify the size of the nucleus, Rutherford calculated the distance of closest
                                    approach (\( r_0 \)) of an alpha particle during a head-on collision with the
                                    nucleus. For this complete conversion of kinetic energy into potential energy to
                                    occur, the collision must be perfectly head-on.

                                <p>
                                    In Bohr's original model of the hydrogen atom, the nucleus is considered infinitely
                                    massive compared to the electron. This simplification allows the nucleus to remain
                                    stationary while the electron orbits around it. However, in reality, the nucleus has
                                    a finite mass and cannot be treated as an immovable point. Both the nucleus and the
                                    electron experience mutual electromagnetic attractions, causing them to accelerate
                                    towards each other. Consequently, they revolve around a common center of mass
                                    (barycenter), which remains stationary in the absence of external forces.
                                </p>

                                    To account for the finite mass of the nucleus, we introduce the <strong>reduced
                                        mass</strong> (\( \mu \)), which replaces the electron mass \( m \) in Bohr's

                                <p>
                                    To incorporate the finite mass of the nucleus into Bohr's model, we use the reduced
                                    mass \( \mu \), allowing us to treat the two-body problem as an effective
                                    single-body problem. The reduced mass is given by:
                                </p>
                                <p>

                                    \mu = \frac{m M}{m + M}\)

                                    Since \( M \) is typically much larger than \( m \) (for hydrogen, \( M \approx 1836
                                    \, m \)), the reduced mass \( \mu \) is slightly less than the electron mass \( m
                                    \). This small reduction significantly impacts the calculated radii and energy
                                    levels.

                                            For the hydrogen atom (\( M \approx 1836 \, m \)), the reduced mass is

                                            This shows that the reduced mass is only marginally less than the electron

                                            the effect of the reduced mass becomes even less pronounced.

                                    In an atom, electrons occupy specific energy levels or orbits as defined by
                                    Bohr's
                                    postulates. The lowest energy level is called the ground state, while higher
                                    energy
                                    levels are excited states. When an electron transitions between energy levels, a
                                    photon is either emitted or absorbed. If the electron moves to a higher energy
                                    level, it absorbs a photon (excitation). If it drops to a lower energy level, it
                                    emits a photon (de-excitation).
                                </p>

                                    During these processes, the energy change \( \Delta E \) equals the energy of
                                    the
                                    photon:
                                </p>
                                <p>

                                <p>
                                    In atomic transitions, only one photon is emitted or absorbed per transition. This
                                    ensures that each energy level change corresponds to a distinct photon emission or
                                    absorption event. The process of transition is extremely rapid, occurring on the
                                    order of \( 10^{-8} \) seconds.
                                </p>

                                    Consider a sample of single-electron systems where all electrons are initially in an
                                    excited state denoted by \(n_i\). During the process of de-excitation, it is not
                                    necessary for every electron to transition directly to the ground state in a single
                                    step. Instead, electrons can move through a series of intermediate energy levels
                                    before reaching the ground state.
                                </p>

                                    For each energy level above the ground state, there are multiple lower energy levels
                                    to which an electron can transition. Specifically, an electron in the \(n\)-th
                                    energy level has the possibility to move down to any of the \(n - 1\) different
                                    lower energy levels. For instance, an electron in the 4th energy level (\(n = 4\))
                                    can transition to the 3rd, 2nd, or 1st energy levels.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Moreover, once an electron transitions to the \((n - 1)\)-th energy level, it can
                                    further transition down to \(n - 2\) different lower energy levels, and so on, until
                                    it finally reaches the ground state. This step-by-step transition process allows for
                                    multiple pathways by which an electron can de-excite.

                                    The total number of unique transitions (and consequently, the number of spectral
                                    lines observed) can be calculated by summing the possible transitions from each
                                    energy level. This is given by the sum of the first \(n - 1\) natural numbers:

                                    This calculation indicates that there are 6 possible spectral lines resulting from
                                    transitions from the 4th energy level to all lower levels. Each transition
                                    corresponds to the emission of a photon with energy equal to the difference between
                                    the initial and final energy levels.

                                    spectra of elements.

                                    The spectral lines of hydrogen are grouped into distinct series based on the final

                                    Conservation of momentum dictates that when a photon is emitted, the atom

                                    the opposite direction. The momentum of the photon is \( p_{\text{photon}} =

                                    At the atomic scale, it is not appropriate to consider energy losses in the form of
                                    friction, heating, sound, or deformation of the body, as we do with macroscopic
                                    objects. For instance, heating is still a form of kinetic energy at the atomic
                                    level, and deformation involves the realignment of arrays of molecules, which does
                                    not apply to individual atoms. Instead, energy loss in atomic collisions occurs
                                    through quantum mechanical processes such as electronic excitations or ionizations.
                                    These quantum transitions are fundamentally different from the classical dissipative
                                    mechanisms observed in larger-scale interactions.

                                    In atomic collisions, energy exchange determines the type of collision that occurs.
                                    An inelastic collision happens when kinetic energy is not conserved due to internal
                                    energy changes, such as the excitation or ionization of electrons. For a collision
                                    to be inelastic, the kinetic energy (\( K \)) of the incident particle must be
                                    sufficient to cause a transition in the target atom.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Specifically, the energy loss (\( \Delta E \)) during the collision must be equal to
                                    or greater than the energy difference between the electron's initial and final
                                    states. If this condition is met (\( K \geq \Delta E \)), the collision results in
                                    the excitation or ionization of the electron, and kinetic energy may not be
                                    conserved.
                                    Otherwise, the collision is elastic, and kinetic energy remains conserved without
                                    any internal energy changes.

                                                \). This is less than the minimum excitation energy (\( 10.2\, \text{eV}
                                                \)), so the collision cannot excite the hydrogen atom. Therefore, the
                                                collision is bound to be elastic.

                                                The maximum energy loss is \( \frac{20.4\, \text{eV}}{2} = 10.2\,
                                                \text{eV} \). This equals the minimum excitation energy, allowing the
                                                collision to be perfectly inelastic, resulting in the excitation of the
                                                hydrogen atom. So in this case, the collision can be either elastic or
                                                perfectly inelastic.

                                                The maximum energy loss is \( \frac{22\, \text{eV}}{2} = 11\, \text{eV}
                                                \). This exceeds the minimum excitation energy, so the collision can be
                                                inelastic, with a possible loss of \( 10.2\, \text{eV} \) of kinetic
                                                energy. Thus, possible types of collision in this case are elastic and
                                                inelastic collisions.

                                    Understanding the conditions under which collisions are elastic or inelastic is
                                    essential in fields like nuclear physics and material science, where atomic
                                    interactions influence the behavior of matter.
