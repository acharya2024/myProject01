                                        Radioactivity is a fundamental phenomenon in nuclear physics, referring to the
                                        spontaneous emission of particles or electromagnetic radiation from the unstable
                                        nuclei of certain atoms as they transition toward a more stable state. This
                                        process of emission of particles by a nuclei sample in the process of achieving
                                        stability is called radioactive decay and the sample is called radioactive
                                        sample.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Radioactive decay is inherently random at the level of individual atoms. It is
                                        impossible to predict exactly when a specific nucleus will decay. This
                                        randomness is due to quantum mechanical principles governing subatomic
                                        particles. However, when dealing with a large ensemble of nuclei, statistical
                                        methods allow us to predict the behavior of the sample as a whole. The decay
                                        processes follow well-defined probability distributions, enabling scientists to
                                        determine decay rates and half-lives.

                                        An analogy can be drawn with a large crowd of people deciding to leave a
                                        stadium: while we cannot predict the exact moment any one person will exit, we
                                        can estimate how long it will take for half the crowd to leave based on
                                        statistical averages.

                                        <strong>Activity</strong> of a radioactive sample quantifies the rate at which
                                        nuclei in a
                                        sample decay, providing a measure of the sample's radioactivity. The activity \(
                                        A \) is defined as the number of disintegrations per unit time:
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        \(\qquad A = -\dfrac{dN}{dt} \)
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Here, \( N \) is the number of undecayed nuclei at time \( t \), and the
                                        negative sign indicates that \( N \) decreases over time. The SI unit of
                                        activity is the Becquerel (Bq), where:
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        \(\qquad 1\, \text{Bq} = 1\, \text{disintegration per second (dps)} \)
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        For practical purposes, especially when dealing with large activities, the Curie
                                        (Ci) is used:
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        \(\qquad 1\, \text{Ci} = 3.7 \times 10^{10}\, \text{Bq} \)
                                    </p>

                                        The Curie is defined based on the activity of 1 gram of radium-226, which
                                        undergoes \( 3.7 \times 10^{10} \) disintegrations per second.

                                        The Radioactivity Law explains how the quantity of undecayed nuclei in a
                                        radioactive sample gradually decreases over time. This decay process is governed
                                        by a characteristic value for each isotope, known as the <strong>decay
                                            constant</strong> \( \lambda \), which reflects the probability of decay per
                                        unit time for any individual nucleus in the sample.
                                    </p>

                                        The likelihood, or probability \( P \), that a single nucleus will decay within
                                        a short time interval \( dt \) is given by:
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        \(\qquad P = \lambda \, dt \)
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Now, if we consider a large number of nuclei \( N \) present in the sample, we
                                        can determine how the total number of nuclei changes over this small time
                                        interval \( dt \). The fractional decrease in the number of nuclei, \(
                                        \dfrac{dN}{N} \), relates to this decay probability:
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        \(\qquad \dfrac{dN}{N} = -P \)
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Substituting \( P = \lambda \, dt \), we obtain:
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        \(\qquad \dfrac{dN}{N} = -\lambda \, dt \)
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        This leads us to the differential equation that describes radioactive decay:
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        \(\qquad \dfrac{dN}{dt} = -\lambda N \)

                                    <p>
                                        The negative sign here indicates that the number of undecayed nuclei \( N \) is
                                        decreasing over time. This equation shows that the decay rate (the rate at which
                                        nuclei decay) is directly proportional to the remaining number of undecayed
                                        nuclei at any given moment. Essentially, the more nuclei present, the faster the
                                        decay process; as nuclei decay and \( N \) decreases, the decay rate also slows
                                        down, following an exponential pattern.

                                        The overall statistical behavior of the radioactive decay can be understood from
                                        following animation in which each radioactive nucleus has constant probability
                                        of undergoing decay in a given interval:

                                        The exponential decay equations 1 and 2, derived from the fundamental decay law,

                                                    Radioactive decay follows an exponential pattern, meaning the number
                                                    of undecayed nuclei continuously decreases over time, but
                                                    theoretically never reaches zero. Additionally, the rate of decrease

                                        Each nucleus in a sample has a different lifetime before it decays, as decay is
                                        a probabilistic process. The mean life \( \tau \) represents the average time a
                                        nucleus exists before decaying.

                                        Consider a sample with an initial number of nuclei \( N \) and a decay constant
                                        \( \lambda \).
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        To find the mean life, let’s analyze the decay process over time. After a time
                                        \( t \), the number of nuclei that decay in the next small interval \( dt \) is
                                        given by the product of the instantaneous activity and \( dt \):
                                    </p>
                                    <p>\( \qquad \text{Number decaying in } dt \text{ after time } t = (\lambda N
                                        e^{-\lambda t})
                                        \, dt\)
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        For these nuclei, the lifetime is \( t \). To calculate the mean lifetime across
                                        all decaying nuclei, we take the weighted average of their lifetimes, with \( t
                                        \) weighted by the number of nuclei decaying at that time:
                                    </p>
                                    <p>\( \qquad \tau = \int_0^\infty t \cdot \lambda e^{-\lambda t} \, dt\)
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Simplifying this integral:
                                    </p>
                                    <p>\( \qquad \tau = \lambda \int_0^\infty t e^{-\lambda t} \, dt =
                                        \dfrac{1}{\lambda}\)
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        Therefore, the mean life \( \tau \) is:
                                    </p>
                                    <p>\( \qquad \tau = \dfrac{1}{\lambda}\)
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        This result indicates that the average lifetime of a nucleus in a radioactive
                                        sample is inversely proportional to the decay constant. The greater the decay
                                        constant \( \lambda \), the shorter the mean life, and vice versa.

                                        age of
                                        organic materials. This method is based on the decay of carbon-14
                                        (\(^{14}\text{C}\)),
                                        an isotope absorbed by living organisms throughout their lifetimes.
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        After death, the intake of carbon-14 ceases, and the isotope decays at a
                                        predictable rate. By measuring the remaining \(^{14}\text{C}\) in a sample
                                        and
                                        applying the radioactive decay law, scientists can calculate the time
                                        elapsed since
                                        the organism's death.
                                    </p>

                                        The decay law for carbon dating helps derive the age of a sample by relating
                                        the
                                        remaining \(^{14}\text{C}\) to its initial quantity. Carbon dating is widely
                                        used
                                        in archaeology and geology, offering reliable insights into the age of
                                        artifacts,
                                        fossils, and other historical samples.

                                        To illustrate the calculation method used in carbon dating, let's consider an
                                        example:
                                    </p>
                                    <p>
                                        An archaeologist discovers a wooden artifact and wants to determine
                                        its age. The current amount of carbon-14 (\(^{14}\text{C}\)) in the wood is
                                        measured to be 25% of the amount found in a living tree of the same type.
                                        Knowing that the half-life of \(^{14}\text{C}\) is approximately 5,730 years, we
                                        can calculate the age of the artifact.
