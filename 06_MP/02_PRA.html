                                    When radiation interacts with matter, the exchange of energy occurs in discrete
                                    packets, one at a time. So, it behaves as if it consists of discrete packets of
                                    energy called <strong>photons</strong>. This concept emerges from
                                    observations like the photoelectric effect, where light transfers energy to
                                    electrons in quantized amounts. In every event of energy exchange between light and
                                    matter, exactly one photon is involved, transferring its entire energy to a system.

                                    The notion of photons revolutionized our understanding of light, bridging the gap
                                    between wave and particle theories. The following diagram illustrates how photons
                                    interact with electrons on a metallic surface, causing phenomena such as the
                                    photoelectric effect.

                                    Photons always travel at the speed of light in a vacuum, denoted as \(c\), and this
                                    speed remains constant in a given medium. Hence, the conventional concept of mass
                                    cannot be used to fully understand the mass of a photon. In physics, mass manifests
                                    in several forms, each playing a distinct role in our understanding of matter and
                                    energy. The primary types of mass include <strong>rest mass</strong>,
                                    <strong>inertial mass</strong>, <strong>gravitational mass</strong>, and
                                    <strong>relativistic mass</strong>. Below, we explore how each type of mass applies
                                    to photons.

                                                Rest mass refers to the intrinsic mass of an object when it is at rest
                                                relative to the observer. For photons, the rest mass (\(m_0\)) is zero.
                                                This means photons are massless particles that cannot be brought to
                                                rest; they always travel at the speed of light. Mathematically, this is

                                                Gravitational mass determines how an object interacts with gravitational
                                                fields. While photons have zero rest mass, they carry energy and
                                                momentum, which allows them to be influenced by gravity. According to
                                                Einstein's general relativity, energy and momentum can curve spacetime,

                                                Relativistic mass is the mass of an object as it increases with its
                                                velocity relative to an observer. However, since photons always travel
                                                at \(c\), the concept of relativistic mass does not apply to them in the
                                                traditional sense used for massive particles. Therefore, the
                                                relativistic mass of a photon is not defined. Instead, photons are
                                                described by their energy and momentum without attributing a
                                                velocity-dependent mass. This perspective aligns with modern physics,
                                                which prefers discussing energy and momentum directly rather than using
                                                relativistic mass.

                                    Experimentally, it's observed that light originates from moving charges, and as
                                    light is formed, the energy of the charged particles decreases. For example,
                                    electrons oscillating in an antenna emit light and continue to propagate through
                                    space until they interact with other charged particles, whose energy increases as
                                    light vanishes. This clearly indicates that light carries both energy and momentum
                                    as it travels.

                                    Another fascinating application is the concept of solar sails for spacecraft
                                    propulsion. Solar sails are large, reflective sails attached to spacecraft that
                                    capture the momentum of photons from the Sun. This method allows spacecraft to
                                    propel through space without the need for traditional fuel, utilizing the continuous
                                    force exerted by solar radiation pressure.
