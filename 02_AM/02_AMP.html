                                    Imagine a specific volume, \( V \), within a fluid. This volume is subject to its
                                    own gravitational pull, essentially its weight. Additionally, the surrounding fluid
                                    exerts pressure forces on the boundaries of this volume, known as the buoyant force.
                                    The diagrams below depict this with \(W\) representing the weight and \(B\) the
                                    buoyant force on the fluid sample:

                                    When our chosen volume remains stable, the buoyant force cancels its weight.
                                    Therefore, we can express this relationship as:
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    \(\qquad B_\text{on fluid sample} = W_\text{fluid sample}\)
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Now, let's think about replacing the fluid in volume \( V \) with another substance.
                                    The surrounding fluid remains the same, and consequently, the pressure remains
                                    consistent throughout. It implies that the pressure exerted on the replaced material
                                    is identical to that which was exerted on the original fluid. The diagrams below
                                    illustrate this concept:
                                </p>

                                    The fundamental concept we just established is that the buoyant force remains
                                    unchanged, whether the volume is occupied by the fluid or any other substance. This
                                    understanding forms the basis of Archimedes' principle, which states:
                                </p>
                                <p class="text-center text-muted text-law">
                                    When an object is immersed, either partially or fully, in a fluid, it experiences a
                                    force called the buoyant force. This force is equal to the weight of the fluid
                                    displaced by the object.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Let's take an example to understand this mathematically. Imagine an object with a
                                    density of \(\rho_\text{object}\) and a volume of \(V\), submerged in a fluid with a
                                    density of \(\rho_\text{fluid}\). The volume of fluid displaced by this object is
                                    \(V\).
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    Thus, the weight of the displaced fluid (or buoyant force) is given by:
                                </p>
                                <p>\(\qquad \text{Buoyant force} = \rho_\text{fluid} V g\)</p>

                                <p>
                                    While the weight of the object is:
                                </p>
                                <p>\(\qquad \text{Weight} = \rho_\text{object} V g\)</p>

                                <p>
                                    Depending on the relative densities of the object and the fluid, the object will
                                    either sink or float when released:
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                    If \(\rho_\text{object} \gt \rho_\text{fluid}\), the object's weight becomes more
                                    than the buoyant force. In such cases, the gravitational pull on the object
                                    dominates the upward buoyant force, causing the object to sink. For instance, when
                                    you drop a metal coin into water, it quickly sinks to the bottom. This occurs
                                    because the density of the metal coin significantly exceeds the density of the
                                    water, leading to a stronger gravitational force acting on the coin compared to the
                                    buoyant force exerted by the water.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Conversely, if \(\rho_\text{object} \lt \rho_\text{fluid}\), the buoyant force
                                    acting
                                    on the object is stronger than its gravitational weight. This ensures the object
                                    remains afloat. An everyday example of this phenomenon is a wooden block in
                                    water. Wood generally has a lower density compared to water. When a wooden block
                                    is released in water, the water exerts a buoyant force on the block that is
                                    greater than the block's weight. As a result, the block floats on the water's
                                    surface instead of sinking. </p>

                                    <p>Archimedes' principle has several implications when objects interact with

                                            When an object is immersed in a fluid, it experiences a buoyant

                                            the surrounding fluid. This upward-acting force reduces the

                                            of the object when measured within the fluid, resulting in the

                                            When the object is fully submerged in a fluid with density
                                            \(\rho_f\), it
                                            displaces an equivalent volume of fluid. By Archimedes' principle,
                                            the
                                            buoyant force exerted on the object equals the weight of the

                                            fluid. The situation is illustrated below:

                                            Floatation is a phenomenon in which an object remains partially or
                                            fully submerged in a fluid without sinking. The ability of an object
                                            to float is dependent on the balance between the weight of the
                                            object and the buoyant force exerted by the fluid.

                                            Consider an object of density \( \rho_{\text{object}} \) and volume
                                            \( V \) which is floating in a fluid of density \(
                                            \rho_{\text{fluid}} \). Let's denote the fraction of the
                                            object's volume submerged in the fluid as \( f \). Therefore, the
                                            volume of the fluid displaced by the object is \( f \times V \).
