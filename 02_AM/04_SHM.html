                                            attached to a string and is suspended as shown in diagram below, the system
                                            is called a simple pendulum. If this pendulum is slightly rotated and is
                                            released, acceleration of the bob will be due to component of its weight
                                            towards mean position. Although the motion is not straight line motion, but
                                            if amplitude of motion is small it can be approximated as straight line
                                            motion and the resulting motion will become SHM. This is shown in following

                                    We observe that every such kind of SHM of particle has some mean position where the
                                    particle is in equilibrium and if the particle gets displaced from mean position,
                                    net force acts on the particle to restore the particle to its equilibrium. Such
                                    resultant force acting on the particle which always acts towards the mean position
                                    is called the restoring force as described previously.

                                    SHM is also observed in waves, such as water waves, sound waves, and electromagnetic
                                    waves. In all these cases, the particles that make up the wave oscillate back and
                                    forth around their equilibrium positions.

                                    SHM has many practical applications in everyday life. For example, the motion of a
                                    car's suspension system as it drives over bumps and potholes can be modeled as
                                    simple harmonic motion. The vibration of a guitar string and the oscillation of a
                                    tuning fork are also examples of simple harmonic motion. SHM is also used in the
                                    design of various mechanical and electrical systems, such as clocks, watches, and
                                    even earthquake-resistant buildings.

                                <p>
                                    In summary, simple harmonic motion is a type of periodic motion that occurs when an
                                    object oscillates back and forth around an equilibrium position under the influence
                                    of a restoring force that is proportional to its displacement. It is a fundamental
                                    concept in physics and has many practical applications in daily life.

                                    there must be a net force acting on the particle when it gets displaced from its
                                    mean position. Such force is known as restoring force. In SHM, restoring force
                                    causes
                                    the particle to again reach its mean position. Hence the restoring force is always

                                                This result for mechanical energy shows that the mechanical energy of

                                                simple harmonic motion under conservative forces, remains constant with
                                                variation in position of particle or passage of time. Thus, mechanical

                                    motion of a particle and its projection on y-axis. The projection performs simple

                                <p> For a particle performing circular motion with constant angular velocity \(\omega\)
                                    and radius \(\vec{r}\), the amplitude of SHM of its projection will be \(r\) and the
                                    angular frequency will be \(\omega\). If initial angular position of the
                                    particle is \(\phi\), then angular position of the particle after time \(t\) is
                                    \(\omega t + \phi\). This angular position of circular motion will be same as phase
                                    of the projection performing SHM. This is shown in following diagram:

                                    For simplicity, we can consider the position vector of particle performing circular
                                    motion as a rod rotating with constant angular velocity \(\omega\). The
                                    instantaneous angular position of the rod is same as the phase of the SHM. Thus, the
                                    rod is often termed as phasor of the SHM. Length of the phasor is equal to amplitude
                                    of SHM while angular position of the phasor represents phase of SHM.

                                    differences in their amplitudes, time period and initial phases are described

                                    amplitude, they will have different extreme positions, but both particles will reach
                                    their respective mean positions simultaneously. Although their mean positions
                                    will be same but since they cover different distances in same time, their speeds at
                                    any given time will be different. At a given time, the particle moving with higher
                                    amplitude will have more speed. The simplified motion is shown in following

                                    If a particle undergoes two SHM simultaneously, the total displacement of the
                                    particle will be vector sum of individual displacements due to each SHM. If a

                                    depends on phase difference between the two individual SHM.

                                    If a system is already in SHM due to a restoring force, other forces may
                                    cause the SHM to change its mean position, frequency or amplitude. Such motion of
                                    system, when forces other than restoring force also act on the system, is called

                                                Consider a SHM in which particle moves around its equilibrium position
                                                \(P\) under the action of restoring force \(\vec{F}_\text{restoring}\).

                                                In SHM, the total mechanical energy remains constant when all forces are
                                                conservative. If a force opposes the particle's velocity, it performs
                                                net negative work
                                                during a complete cycle, causing the energy of the system to decrease.
                                                This force is called damping force, and the phenomenon is called damped
                                                oscillation. The restoring force still drives the particle to the
                                                equilibrium position, but the damping force removes energy from the
                                                system, and the amplitude of the oscillations gradually decreases until
                                                the particle comes to rest.

                                                It can be observed that the equivalent amplitude of the
                                                motion decrease exponentially with time as the particle loses energy due
                                                to the damping force. For example, consider a mass attached to a spring.
                                                If you push the mass and then let go, it will oscillate back and forth
                                                due to the spring force. However, if you place the mass in a viscous
                                                fluid, such as honey, the motion will be damped, and the amplitude and
                                                frequency of the motion will decrease until the mass comes to rest.

                                                Damped oscillation is a common phenomenon encountered in our daily
                                                lives. A swing is an excellent example of a system that undergoes simple
                                                harmonic motion when pushed by a small amount. The swing moves back and
                                                forth in a regular manner with a constant period and amplitude. However,
                                                air resistance acting as a damping force against the swing's motion
                                                eventually brings it to rest. The damping force removes energy from the
                                                system, causing the amplitude of the oscillations to decrease gradually

                                                In summary, damping force acts as an opposing force against the motion
                                                of the system, resulting in the dissipation of energy from the system.
                                                Consequently, the amplitude of the oscillations decreases with time, and
                                                the system ultimately comes to rest.
