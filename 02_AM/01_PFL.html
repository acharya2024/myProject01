                                    While these definitions provide a general understanding of the states of matter,
                                    they aren't precise. For instance, substances like asphalt and plastics,
                                    typically regarded as solids, can behave like liquids over extended periods.
                                    Additionally, the state of a substance—whether solid, liquid, or gas—often depends
                                    on temperature and pressure conditions. The time taken for a substance to reshape
                                    under external forces often determines its classification in specific analyses.

                                    A fluid is a collection of molecules that are randomly arranged and held together by
                                    weak cohesive forces and by forces exerted by the walls of a container. Their
                                    reduced intermolecular forces enable fluid layers to slide over one another,
                                    granting them the ability to flow. As highlighted before, both liquids and gases
                                    possess this flowing property, categorizing them as fluids.

                                    In this chapter on fluid mechanics, we begin with fluid statics, examining the
                                    mechanics of stationary fluids. We'll derive expressions for the pressure exerted by
                                    a fluid, understand the variations in pressure, and the buoyant forces
                                    exerted by fluids. Subsequently, we transition to fluid dynamics, focusing on the
                                    behavior of moving fluids.

                                    In our treatment of the mechanics of fluids, we shall see that we do not need
                                    to learn any new physical principles to explain such effects as the buoyant force
                                    acting on a submerged object and the dynamic lift acting on an airplane wing.
                                    Established principles such as the laws of motion and energy conservation equip us
                                    with the necessary tools for these analyses.

                                    Density is a property of a material independent of its shape and size. Density,
                                    generally represented by \(\rho\), is
                                    defined as mass \(dM\) of the material per unit its volume \(dV\). Hence,
                                </p>
                                <p>

                                <p>
                                    The SI unit of density is \(\text{kg}/\text{m}^3\). The density water is suggested
                                    to be remembered as \(1,000\text{kg}/\text{m}^3\) or \(1 \text{kg}/\text{L}\) or \(1
                                    \text{g}/\text{cm}^3\)

                                    The ratio of density of a material with that of density of water is called relative
                                    density or specific density or specific gravity. This being a ratio, has no units.
                                    For example, stating specific density of
                                    aluminium being 2.7 means its density is \(2.7\times 10^3\text{kg}/\text{m}^3\).

                                    If two different materials are mixed, the equivalent density of the mixture can be
                                    calculated by formula:

                                    infinitesimally small area \(dA\). The pressure \(P\) associated with this area can
                                    be expressed mathematically as::

                                    The unit for pressure in the SI system is the Pascal (Pa),

                                    In the mechanics of solids, the primary focus is on forces. However, in fluid
                                    mechanics, the concept of pressure becomes important.
                                    Even in a stationary fluid, its molecules are in constant motion. As a result,
                                    surfaces in contact with the fluid experience continuous collisions from these
                                    moving molecules. These collisions result into a perpendicular force distributed
                                    over the
                                    contact area, leading to the concept of pressure.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Imagine a hypothetical pressure-sensing device as illustrated below. For the sake of
                                    our discussion, let's assume the device's interior contains a vacuum and is equipped
                                    with an ideal spring.</p>

                                    The greater the external fluid pressure, the more the spring inside the device
                                    compresses. At equilibrium, the compression of the spring directly relates to the
                                    external fluid pressure. Throughout this chapter, we'll employ this conceptual

                                    Consider two parallel surfaces, \(S_1\) and \(S_2\), each possessing an area of
                                    \(dA\), situated within the fluid. Assume the pressures at these respective surfaces
                                    to be \(P_1\) and \(P_2\).

                                    If the segment of fluid enclosed between \(S_1\) and \(S_2\) experiences no net
                                    external force, then the total force acting upon this fluid segment must be equal to
                                    zero. This leads us to the relationship:

                                    In situations where the pressures at \(S_1\) and \(S_2\) are not same, the fluid
                                    starts to
                                    move, transitioning from regions of high pressure toward those of less
                                    pressure. This motion persists until equilibrium is attained, and the pressures at
                                    both surfaces equalize. If an incremental pressure \(\delta P\) is externally
                                    applied at a specific location within the fluid and maintained, upon attaining a
                                    steady state, the entire fluid's pressure will adjust uniformly, reflecting an
                                    increment of \(\delta P\) throughout. This phenomenon aptly illustrates Pascal's
                                    law, which is:

                                    In a closed system containing an incompressible fluid, if there is any change in
                                    pressure at one location, this change is evenly distributed throughout the entire
                                    fluid volume. This fundamental principle is recognized as Pascal's law.

                                    When an external force acts uniformly on every particle within a fluid, the pressure
                                    at each point within the fluid does not remain constant. Instead, the pressure
                                    adjusts so that, for any given fluid segment, the combined force resulting from the
                                    pressure variation balances the externally imposed force. In a fluid situated in a
                                    region affected by gravitational acceleration, the pressure is not uniform. Instead,
                                    it varies to counterbalance the weight of specific fluid segments.

                                The pressure forces acting on these surfaces are in horizontal direction. Since there is

                                    The pressure gradient denotes the rate at which pressure changes with respect to

                                    Being a vector quantity, the pressure gradient can be represented in vector form

                                    Thus, in stationary fluids, the pressure gradient is zero horizontally, and is
                                    non zero along vertical direction. Representing the pressure gradient as \(

                                    frame aligns with the container, the container appears stationary. However,
                                    Newton's laws requires accounting for pseudo forces. From this perspective,
                                    the effective force on a mass \( m \) particle becomes:
                                </p>

                                <p>\(\qquad F_\text{effective} = m\vec{g} - m\vec{a} \)</p>

                                <p>\( \Rightarrow\quad\vec{g}_\text{effective} = \vec{g} - \vec{a} \)</p>

                                    Consequently, the pressure gradient in such accelerated fluids is:
                                </p>

                                <p>\(\qquad \vec{p} = \rho \vec{g}_\text{effective} \)</p>

                                            It is important to note that the pressure gradient and the pressure

                                <p>The free surface of a liquid is the interface between the liquid and the gas above
                                    it, usually the atmosphere. In other scenarios, this interface could also be with
                                    another immiscible liquid or a vacuum. The existence of a boundary surface for
                                    liquids is due to a phenomenon called <em>surface tension</em>. The molecules at the
                                    surface experience an inward force due to cohesive interactions with molecules
                                    beneath them. However, there's no similar force from above, creating a "tension"
                                    that forms a distinguishable boundary. The description of surface tension
                                    will be given in detail in later sections.

                                    as shown in above diagram. We can examine the difference in pressure between these
                                    points due to the horizontal acceleration:

                                    Alternatively, we can derive this relation if we observe the forces acting on the
                                    particles at surface relative to the container. This is shown below:</p>

                                    acceleration to gravitational force can be used to predict the orientation of the

                                    When a liquid is contained within a vessel that's set into rotational motion, the
                                    liquid tends to adjust itself in response to the centrifugal force arising from the
                                    rotation. This adjustment often results in the formation of a parabolic free
                                    surface, where the liquid is pushed outward, raising its level near the walls of the
                                    container and lowering it at the center.

                                    This phenomenon can be witnessed in everyday life, such as when a bucket of water is
                                    swirled around. The water tends to rise along the walls of the bucket, creating a
                                    depression in the center.

                                    To understand this behavior, consider a particle of mass \(m\) on surface of such
                                    rotating liquid as shown in above diagram. The co-ordinates of this particle is
                                    shown as \(\left(x,y\right)\). Relative to this particle itself, the forces acting
                                    are the weight of the particle \(\left(mg\right)\) and the pseudo force
                                    \(\left(\omega^2 x\right)\) directed outwards from the axis of rotation. If the
                                    resultant of these forces makes an angle \(\theta\) with vertical, then the surface
                                    will be making the same angle \(\theta\) with horizontal at that location. The value
                                    of
                                    \(\tan\theta\) can be written as:
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    \(\qquad \tan\theta=\frac{m\omega^2 x}{mg}\)
                                </p>
                                <p>

                                    This is the slope of the surface at any general point \(\left(x,y\right)\). To find
                                    equation of the curve visible in the diagram, we write slope to be same as
                                    \(\frac{dy}{dx}\) and then perform the necessary integration. This is done below:
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    \(\qquad \frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{\omega^2 x}{g}\)
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    \(\Rightarrow\quad \int{dy}=\frac{\omega^2 }{g}\int{xdx}\)
                                </p>

                                    \(\Rightarrow\quad y=\frac{\omega^2 x^2}{2g}\)
                                </p>

                                    The equation represents a parabolic curve. If this parabolic curve is rotated about
                                    the axis of rotation, the surface formed represents the actual surface of liquid in
                                    rotation. Such surface formed by rotation of parabola is called a paraboloid.
