If \\(n'\\) number of \\(\\beta\\) particles are emitted in the next two seconds from the sample, then the half-life of the sample is (\\(t_{half\\ life} \\gg 2\\text{ sec}\\)).\\n(A) \\(\\frac{n'}{2}\\)\\n(B) \\(0.693 \\times \\frac{2n}{n'}\\)\\n(C) \\(0.693 \\times \\ln\\left(\\frac{2n}{n'}\\right)\\)\\n(D) \\(0.693 \\times \\frac{n}{n'}\\)",
