      "solution": "Consider a system of point charges where each charge is in equilibrium due to the net electrostatic force exerted by all other charges. We will analyze the electrostatic potential energy of this system.\\nImagine scaling up the system, increasing the distances between every pair of charges by a common factor k (\\(k \\gt 1\\)). Since electrostatic force is proportional to \\(1/r^2\\), scaling all distances by \\(k\\) reduces each individual force by a factor of \\(1/k^2\\). Because each charge was initially in equilibrium (net force of zero), and each force acting on a charge is scaled by the same factor, the net force on each charge remains zero after scaling.\\nNow, let's consider the work done on the system during this scaling process. This scaling is performed by an external agent, not the electrostatic forces. As each charge is moved outwards by the external agent, the net electrostatic force on it remains zero. Since work done on a charge is the integral of the net force on it over its displacement, and the net force is consistently zero, the work done by electrostatic forces on each charge during scaling is zero. Consequently, the total work done by electrostatic forces on the entire system, observed from any inertial frame, is also zero.\\nBecause electrostatic forces are conservative, the work done by them is equal to the negative change in potential energy: \\(W = -\\Delta U\\). Since the work done is zero, the change in potential energy (\\(\\Delta U\\)) during scaling is also zero. This means the potential energy of the scaled system (\\(U_{final}\\)) is equal to the potential energy of the original system (\\(U_{initial}\\)).\\nIf we scale the system to infinity (\\(k \\rightarrow \\infty\\)), the charges become infinitely separated, and their electrostatic interaction becomes zero. By definition, the electrostatic potential energy of an infinitely separated system of charges is zero (\\(U_{final} = 0\\)).\\n\\nSince \\(U_{final} = U_{initial}\\) and \\(U_{final} = 0\\), we conclude that the initial potential energy \\(U_{initial}\\) must also be zero.\\nTherefore, for a system of charges in equilibrium, the electrostatic potential energy of the system is zero.",
