      "questionText": "A man standing on the edge of a swimming pool looks at a stone lying at the bottom of the pool. The depth of the swimming pool is \\(h\\). At what distance from the surface of water is the image of the stone formed, if the line of sight outside water makes an angle \\(\\theta\\) with the normal to the surface?",
      "solution": "This problem is not a simple case of normal viewing where the apparent depth is given by \\(h' = \\dfrac{h}{\\mu}\\). Here, the observer is at the edge of the pool, and the angle of observation \\(\\theta\\) is significant.\\nLet us draw two rays OA and OA'. OA is passing through the edge of the pool. The rays incident on the interface in the region AA' after refraction will reach the eye of the observer. Let us now produce the refracted rays backwards so that their point of intersection (I) is the place where the image of the object O is formed.  So OB = h is the real depth, and IB' = h' is the apparent depth. To calculate h', let us consider triangles OAA' and IAA'. From triangle OAA', we calculate AA' and also from triangle IAA', we again calculate AA' (common side to both triangles) and equate both.\\nFrom A, drop a perpendicular on OA at the point N so that AN is an arc of a circular portion of radius OA = h/cosφ as shown in figure.\\n\\nDIAGRAM[1,300]\\nSince \\(AN = (OA)d\\phi = \\left(\\dfrac{h}{\\cos\\phi}\\right)d\\phi\\)\\nIn triangle AAN' we have \\(\\cos\\phi = \\dfrac{AN}{AA'}\\)\\n\\(\\Rightarrow AA' = \\dfrac{AN}{\\cos\\phi} = \\left(\\dfrac{h}{\\cos^2\\phi}\\right)d\\phi \\quad ...(1)\\)\\nSimilarly, from triangle IAA', we get\\n\\(AA' = \\left(\\dfrac{h'}{\\cos^2\\theta}\\right)d\\theta \\quad ...(2)\\)\\nEquating equations (1) and (2), we get\\n\\(\\left(\\dfrac{h}{\\cos^2\\phi}\\right)d\\phi = \\left(\\dfrac{h'}{\\cos^2\\theta}\\right)d\\theta\\)\\n\\(\\Rightarrow h' = h\\left(\\dfrac{\\cos^2\\theta}{\\cos^2\\phi}\\right)\\dfrac{d\\phi}{d\\theta} \\quad ...(3)\\)\\nNow, applying Snell's Law at A, we get\\n\\(\\mu = \\dfrac{\\sin\\theta}{\\sin\\phi} \\quad ...(4)\\)\\n\\(\\Rightarrow \\sin\\theta = \\mu \\sin\\phi\\)\\nDifferentiating both sides, we get\\n\\(\\cos\\theta d\\theta = \\mu \\cos\\phi d\\phi\\)\\n\\(\\Rightarrow \\dfrac{d\\phi}{d\\theta} = \\dfrac{\\cos\\theta}{\\mu\\cos\\phi} \\quad ...(5)\\)\\nPut equation (5) in (1), we get\\n\\(h' = \\dfrac{h}{\\mu}\\left(\\dfrac{\\cos^3\\theta}{\\cos^3\\phi}\\right) \\quad ...(6)\\)\\nFurther from equation (4), we get \\(\\sin\\phi = \\dfrac{\\sin\\theta}{\\mu}\\)\\n\\(\\Rightarrow \\cos\\phi = \\sqrt{1 - \\sin^2\\phi} = \\sqrt{1 - \\dfrac{\\sin^2\\theta}{\\mu^2}}\\)\\n\\(\\Rightarrow \\cos^3\\phi = \\left(1 - \\dfrac{\\sin^2\\theta}{\\mu^2}\\right)^{\\dfrac{3}{2}} = \\dfrac{(\\mu^2 - \\sin^2\\theta)^{\\dfrac{3}{2}}}{\\mu^3} \\quad ...(7)\\)\\nSubstituting equation (7) in (6), we get\\n\\(h' = \\dfrac{\\mu^2 h \\cos^3\\theta}{(\\mu^2 - \\sin^2\\theta)^{3/2}}\\)",

Their optical axes are vertically displaced, such that the optical axis of L2 is a distance \\(d\\) (where \\(d \\ll f\\)) above the optical axis of L1. Consider a parallel beam of rays incident from the left, parallel to the principal axis of the first lens (L1).  Taking the center of the first lens (L1) as the origin of the coordinate system, and the principal axis of L1 as the x-axis, determine the coordinates of the final focal point where this parallel beam converges after passing through both lenses. Assume paraxial approximation.\\n\\nDIAGRAM[1,300]",
      "solution": "1. *Image Formation by the First Lens (L1):*\\nSince a parallel beam of rays is incident on the first lens (L1), the image formed by L1 will be at its focal point.  Given that the origin O is at the center of L1, and the principal axis of L1 is the x-axis, the focal point F of L1 will be at a distance \\(f\\) along the positive x-axis from O. Let this point be the image \\(I_1\\).  Thus, the coordinates of \\(I_1\\) are \\((f, 0)\\).\\n\\n2. *Object for the Second Lens (L2):*\\nThe image \\(I_1\\) formed by the first lens acts as the object for the second lens (L2).  The second lens (L2) is located at a distance \\(3f\\) horizontally from L1.  Therefore, the object distance \\(u\\) for the second lens (L2), measured from the center of L2, is \\(u = -2f\\) (since \\(I_1\\) is at \\(f\\) and L2 is at \\(3f\\), and the object is to the left of L2).\\nThe vertical position of \\(I_1\\) with respect to the optical axis of L1 is 0.  However, the optical axis of L2 is displaced vertically upwards by a distance \\(d\\) with respect to L1's optical axis.  Therefore, the vertical position of \\(I_1\\) with respect to the principal axis PQ of L2 is \\(h_o = -d\\) (negative sign because \\(I_1\\) is below the optical axis of L2).\\n\\n3. *Image Formation by the Second Lens (L2):*\\nUsing the lens formula for the second lens (L2):\\n\\(\\dfrac{1}{v} - \\dfrac{1}{u} = \\dfrac{1}{f}\\)\\nSubstituting \\(u = -2f\\) and focal length \\(f\\):\\n\\(\\dfrac{1}{v} - \\dfrac{1}{-2f} = \\dfrac{1}{f}\\)\\n\\(\\dfrac{1}{v} + \\dfrac{1}{2f} = \\dfrac{1}{f}\\)\\n\\(\\dfrac{1}{v} = \\dfrac{1}{f} - \\dfrac{1}{2f} = \\dfrac{1}{2f}\\)\\n\\(v = 2f\\)\\nThus, the image formed by the second lens is at a distance \\(2f\\) to the right of L2.\\n\\n4. *Magnification and Vertical Position of Final Image:*\\nThe magnification produced by the second lens is given by:\\n\\(m = \\dfrac{h_i}{h_o} = \\dfrac{v}{u} = \\dfrac{2f}{-2f} = -1\\)\\nSince \\(h_o = -d\\), the height of the final image \\(h_i\\) is:\\n\\(h_i = m \\times h_o = (-1) \\times (-d) = d\\)\\nThe negative magnification for the second lens indicates that the image is inverted *with respect to the object for the second lens*, which was already below the principal axis of L2. Since the object \\(I_1\\) was at a distance \\(d\\) below the principal axis of L2 and magnification is -1, the image will be at a distance \\(d\\) *above* the principal axis PQ of lens L2.\\n\\n5. *Coordinates of Final Image:*\\nDIAGRAM[2,300]\\nThe x-coordinate of the final image is the position along the x-axis, measured from the origin O.  The image is formed at a distance \\(2f\\) to the right of L2. Since L2 is at \\(3f\\) from O, the x-coordinate of the final image is \\(3f + 2f = 5f\\).\\nThe y-coordinate of the final image is the vertical position relative to the principal axis of L1 (x-axis). Since the final image is formed at a height \\(d\\) above the principal axis PQ of the second lens, and PQ itself is at a height \\(d\\) above the x-axis, the y-coordinate of the final image, relative to the x-axis, is also \\(d\\). However, magnification is -1 relative to object of second lens, and object was -d below principal axis of second lens PQ. Hence image is +d wrt PQ axis. Now PQ axis itself was +d above first axis. Therefore y-coordinate of final image with respect to first axis is d as well, with respect to PQ is d as well.\\nThus, the coordinates of the final image are \\((5f, d)\\).\\n\\nActually magnification is -1, meaning inverted. Since object \\(I_1\\) was at -d below principal axis PQ of L2, hence image will be inverted and at +d. So height is d above PQ. PQ axis is d above OX axis. Total height with OX axis is 2d. Thus y-coordinate is 2d.Final coordinates of the point where the parallel beam of rays finally gets focussed are \\((5f,2d)\\).",

Since \\(\\theta_2 + \\theta_3 = 90^\\circ\\), if \\(\\theta_2\\) increases, then \\(\\theta_3\\) will decrease. If \\(\\theta_3\\) decreases, \\(\\sin \\theta_3\\) decreases, so \\(\\mu \\sin \\theta_3\\) becomes less than 1. Therefore, the ray will emerge out in air, and it will no longer be grazing emergence (angle of refraction will be less than 90°).\n\n(d) **Effect of slightly decreasing \\(\\theta\\):**\\nIf angle \\(\\theta\\) is slightly decreased, \\(\\theta_2\\) will decrease and \\(\\theta_3\\) will increase. If \\(\\theta_3\\) increases beyond the critical angle, total internal reflection will take place at point Q, and the light ray will not emerge from face AC.",
