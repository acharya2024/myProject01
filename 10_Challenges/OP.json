      "questionText": "A man standing on the edge of a swimming pool looks at a stone lying at the bottom of the pool. The depth of the swimming pool is \\(h\\). At what distance from the surface of water is the image of the stone formed if the line of sight makes an angle \\(\\theta\\) with the normal to the surface?",
      "solution": "This problem is not a simple case of normal viewing where the apparent depth is given by \\(h' = \\frac{h}{\\mu}\\). Here, the observer is at the edge of the pool, and the angle of observation \\(\\theta\\) is significant.\\n\\nDIAGRAM[1,300]\\nLet us draw two rays OA and OA’. OA is passing through the edge of the pool. The rays incident on the interface in the region AA’ after refraction will reach the eye of the observer. Let us now produce the refracted rays backwards so that their point of intersection (I) is the place where the image of the object O is formed.  So OB = h is the real depth, and IB’ = h’ is the apparent depth. To calculate h’, let us consider triangles OAA’ and IAA’. From triangle OAA’, we calculate AA’ and also from triangle IAA’, we again calculate AA’ (common side to both triangles) and equate both.\\nFrom A, drop a perpendicular on OA at the point N so that AN is an arc of a circular portion of radius OA = h/cosφ as shown in figure.\\n\\nDIAGRAM[2,200]\\nSince \\(AN = (OA)d\\phi = \\left(\\frac{h}{\\cos\\phi}\\right)d\\phi\\)\\nIn triangle AAN’ we have \\(\\cos\\phi = \\frac{AN}{AA'}\\)\\n\\(\\implies AA' = \\frac{AN}{\\cos\\phi} = \\left(\\frac{h}{\\cos^2\\phi}\\right)d\\phi \\quad ...(1)\\)\\nSimilarly, from triangle IAA’, we get\\n\\(AA' = \\left(\\frac{h'}{\\cos^2\\theta}\\right)d\\theta \\quad ...(2)\\)\\nEquating equations (1) and (2), we get\\n\\(\\left(\\frac{h}{\\cos^2\\phi}\\right)d\\phi = \\left(\\frac{h'}{\\cos^2\\theta}\\right)d\\theta\\)\\n\\(\\implies h' = h\\left(\\frac{\\cos^2\\theta}{\\cos^2\\phi}\\right)\\frac{d\\phi}{d\\theta} \\quad ...(3)\\)\\nNow, applying Snell’s Law at A, we get\\n\\(\\mu = \\frac{\\sin\\theta}{\\sin\\phi} \\quad ...(4)\\)\\n\\(\\implies \\sin\\theta = \\mu \\sin\\phi\\)\\nDifferentiating both sides, we get\\n\\(\\cos\\theta d\\theta = \\mu \\cos\\phi d\\phi\\)\\n\\(\\implies \\frac{d\\phi}{d\\theta} = \\frac{\\cos\\theta}{\\mu\\cos\\phi} \\quad ...(5)\\)\\nPut equation (5) in (1), we get\\n\\(h' = \\frac{h}{\\mu}\\left(\\frac{\\cos^3\\theta}{\\cos^3\\phi}\\right) \\quad ...(6)\\)\\nFurther from equation (4), we get \\(\\sin\\phi = \\frac{\\sin\\theta}{\\mu}\\)\\n\\(\\implies \\cos\\phi = \\sqrt{1 - \\sin^2\\phi} = \\sqrt{1 - \\frac{\\sin^2\\theta}{\\mu^2}}\\)\\n\\(\\implies \\cos^3\\phi = \\left(1 - \\frac{\\sin^2\\theta}{\\mu^2}\\right)^{\\frac{3}{2}} = \\frac{(\\mu^2 - \\sin^2\\theta)^{\\frac{3}{2}}}{\\mu^3} \\quad ...(7)\\)\\nSubstituting equation (7) in (6), we get\\n\\(h' = \\frac{\\mu^2 h \\cos^3\\theta}{(\\mu^2 - \\sin^2\\theta)^{3/2}}\\)",
