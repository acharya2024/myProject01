      "questionText": "A man standing on the edge of a swimming pool looks at a stone lying at the bottom of the pool. The depth of the swimming pool is \\(h\\). At what distance from the surface of water is the image of the stone formed, if the line of sight outside water makes an angle \\(\\theta\\) with the normal to the surface?",
      "solution": "This problem is not a simple case of normal viewing where the apparent depth is given by \\(h' = \\dfrac{h}{\\mu}\\). Here, the observer is at the edge of the pool, and the angle of observation \\(\\theta\\) is significant.\\nLet us draw two rays OA and OA'. OA is passing through the edge of the pool. The rays incident on the interface in the region AA' after refraction will reach the eye of the observer. Let us now produce the refracted rays backwards so that their point of intersection (I) is the place where the image of the object O is formed.  So OB = h is the real depth, and IB' = h' is the apparent depth. To calculate h', let us consider triangles OAA' and IAA'. From triangle OAA', we calculate AA' and also from triangle IAA', we again calculate AA' (common side to both triangles) and equate both.\\nFrom A, drop a perpendicular on OA at the point N so that AN is an arc of a circular portion of radius OA = h/cosφ as shown in figure.\\nDIAGRAM[1,300]\\nSince \\(AN = (OA)d\\phi = \\left(\\dfrac{h}{\\cos\\phi}\\right)d\\phi\\)\\nIn triangle AAN' we have \\(\\cos\\phi = \\dfrac{AN}{AA'}\\)\\n\\(\\Rightarrow AA' = \\dfrac{AN}{\\cos\\phi} = \\left(\\dfrac{h}{\\cos^2\\phi}\\right)d\\phi \\quad ...(1)\\)\\nSimilarly, from triangle IAA', we get\\n\\(AA' = \\left(\\dfrac{h'}{\\cos^2\\theta}\\right)d\\theta \\quad ...(2)\\)\\nEquating equations (1) and (2), we get\\n\\(\\left(\\dfrac{h}{\\cos^2\\phi}\\right)d\\phi = \\left(\\dfrac{h'}{\\cos^2\\theta}\\right)d\\theta\\)\\n\\(\\Rightarrow h' = h\\left(\\dfrac{\\cos^2\\theta}{\\cos^2\\phi}\\right)\\dfrac{d\\phi}{d\\theta} \\quad ...(3)\\)\\nNow, applying Snell's Law at A, we get\\n\\(\\mu = \\dfrac{\\sin\\theta}{\\sin\\phi} \\quad ...(4)\\)\\n\\(\\Rightarrow \\sin\\theta = \\mu \\sin\\phi\\)\\nDifferentiating both sides, we get\\n\\(\\cos\\theta d\\theta = \\mu \\cos\\phi d\\phi\\)\\n\\(\\Rightarrow \\dfrac{d\\phi}{d\\theta} = \\dfrac{\\cos\\theta}{\\mu\\cos\\phi} \\quad ...(5)\\)\\nPut equation (5) in (1), we get\\n\\(h' = \\dfrac{h}{\\mu}\\left(\\dfrac{\\cos^3\\theta}{\\cos^3\\phi}\\right) \\quad ...(6)\\)\\nFurther from equation (4), we get \\(\\sin\\phi = \\dfrac{\\sin\\theta}{\\mu}\\)\\n\\(\\Rightarrow \\cos\\phi = \\sqrt{1 - \\sin^2\\phi} = \\sqrt{1 - \\dfrac{\\sin^2\\theta}{\\mu^2}}\\)\\n\\(\\Rightarrow \\cos^3\\phi = \\left(1 - \\dfrac{\\sin^2\\theta}{\\mu^2}\\right)^{\\dfrac{3}{2}} = \\dfrac{(\\mu^2 - \\sin^2\\theta)^{\\dfrac{3}{2}}}{\\mu^3} \\quad ...(7)\\)\\nSubstituting equation (7) in (6), we get\\n\\(h' = \\dfrac{\\mu^2 h \\cos^3\\theta}{(\\mu^2 - \\sin^2\\theta)^{3/2}}\\)",

Their optical axes are vertically displaced, such that the optical axis of L2 is a distance \\(d\\) (where \\(d \\ll f\\)) above the optical axis of L1. Consider a parallel beam of rays incident from the left, parallel to the principal axis of the first lens (L1).  Taking the center of the first lens (L1) as the origin of the coordinate system, and the principal axis of L1 as the x-axis, determine the coordinates of the final focal point where this parallel beam converges after passing through both lenses. Assume paraxial approximation.\\nDIAGRAM[1,300]",
      "solution": "1. *Image Formation by the First Lens (L1):*\\nSince a parallel beam of rays is incident on the first lens (L1), the image formed by L1 will be at its focal point.  Given that the origin O is at the center of L1, and the principal axis of L1 is the x-axis, the focal point F of L1 will be at a distance \\(f\\) along the positive x-axis from O. Let this point be the image \\(I_1\\).  Thus, the coordinates of \\(I_1\\) are \\((f, 0)\\).\\n2. *Object for the Second Lens (L2):*\\nThe image \\(I_1\\) formed by the first lens acts as the object for the second lens (L2).  The second lens (L2) is located at a distance \\(3f\\) horizontally from L1.  Therefore, the object distance \\(u\\) for the second lens (L2), measured from the center of L2, is \\(u = -2f\\) (since \\(I_1\\) is at \\(f\\) and L2 is at \\(3f\\), and the object is to the left of L2).\\nThe vertical position of \\(I_1\\) with respect to the optical axis of L1 is 0.  However, the optical axis of L2 is displaced vertically upwards by a distance \\(d\\) with respect to L1's optical axis.  Therefore, the vertical position of \\(I_1\\) with respect to the principal axis PQ of L2 is \\(h_o = -d\\) (negative sign because \\(I_1\\) is below the optical axis of L2).\\n3. *Image Formation by the Second Lens (L2):*\\nUsing the lens formula for the second lens (L2):\\n\\(\\dfrac{1}{v} - \\dfrac{1}{u} = \\dfrac{1}{f}\\)\\nSubstituting \\(u = -2f\\) and focal length \\(f\\):\\n\\(\\dfrac{1}{v} - \\dfrac{1}{-2f} = \\dfrac{1}{f}\\)\\n\\(\\dfrac{1}{v} + \\dfrac{1}{2f} = \\dfrac{1}{f}\\)\\n\\(\\dfrac{1}{v} = \\dfrac{1}{f} - \\dfrac{1}{2f} = \\dfrac{1}{2f}\\)\\n\\(v = 2f\\)\\nThus, the image formed by the second lens is at a distance \\(2f\\) to the right of L2.\\n4. *Magnification and Vertical Position of Final Image:*\\nThe magnification produced by the second lens is given by:\\n\\(m = \\dfrac{h_i}{h_o} = \\dfrac{v}{u} = \\dfrac{2f}{-2f} = -1\\)\\nSince \\(h_o = -d\\), the height of the final image \\(h_i\\) is:\\n\\(h_i = m \\times h_o = (-1) \\times (-d) = d\\)\\nThe negative magnification for the second lens indicates that the image is inverted *with respect to the object for the second lens*, which was already below the principal axis of L2. Since the object \\(I_1\\) was at a distance \\(d\\) below the principal axis of L2 and magnification is -1, the image will be at a distance \\(d\\) *above* the principal axis PQ of lens L2.\\n5. *Coordinates of Final Image:*\\nDIAGRAM[2,300]\\nThe x-coordinate of the final image is the position along the x-axis, measured from the origin O.  The image is formed at a distance \\(2f\\) to the right of L2. Since L2 is at \\(3f\\) from O, the x-coordinate of the final image is \\(3f + 2f = 5f\\).\\nThe y-coordinate of the final image is the vertical position relative to the principal axis of L1 (x-axis). Since the final image is formed at a height \\(d\\) above the principal axis PQ of the second lens, and PQ itself is at a height \\(d\\) above the x-axis, the y-coordinate of the final image, relative to the x-axis, is also \\(d\\). However, magnification is -1 relative to object of second lens, and object was -d below principal axis of second lens PQ. Hence image is +d wrt PQ axis. Now PQ axis itself was +d above first axis. Therefore y-coordinate of final image with respect to first axis is d as well, with respect to PQ is d as well.\\nThus, the coordinates of the final image are \\((5f, d)\\).\\nActually magnification is -1, meaning inverted. Since object \\(I_1\\) was at -d below principal axis PQ of L2, hence image will be inverted and at +d. So height is d above PQ. PQ axis is d above OX axis. Total height with OX axis is 2d. Thus y-coordinate is 2d.Final coordinates of the point where the parallel beam of rays finally gets focussed are \\((5f,2d)\\).",

In the co-ordinate system shown, find the co-ordinates of the point where the rays will focus or appear to be diverging from.\\nDIAGRAM[1,200]",
      "solution": "Let's analyze the refraction of light through the plano-concave lens step-by-step:\\n*(1) Refraction at the Plane Surface (AB):*\\nThe plane surface AB is tilted at a small angle \\(\\theta\\) with respect to the usual plane surface. A parallel beam of light is incident normally on the *usual* plane surface, meaning it is incident at a small angle \\(i = \\theta\\) with the *tilted* plane surface AB. The normal to the tilted surface AB is denoted as 'n' in Figure-5.78.\\nDIAGRAM[2,250]\\nAngle of incidence, \\(i = \\theta\\) (as shown in Figure-5.78, angle between incident ray IR and normal n is \\(\\theta\\)).\\nApplying Snell's law at the plane surface (air to glass):\\n\\(1 \\cdot \\sin i = \\mu \\sin r\\)\\nFor small angles, \\(\\sin \\theta \\approx \\theta\\) and \\(\\sin r \\approx r\\). Thus,\\n\\(\\theta \\approx \\mu r\\)\\nDeviation \\(\\delta\\) at the plane surface is the angle between the incident ray and the refracted ray. For small angles, deviation is approximately:\\n\\(\\delta = i - r = \\theta - r = \\theta - \\dfrac{\\theta}{\\mu} = \\theta \\left(1 - \\dfrac{1}{\\mu}\\right)\\)\\nThe refracted rays, after passing through the plane surface, appear to be diverging from a point A. The lateral displacement BA (perpendicular to the original direction of light) can be approximated as \\(BA = |\\delta| \\times v\\) where v is the distance from A to the point of focus or divergence. For small angle, lateral shift  \\(y \\approx d\\) (thickness approx zero for thin lens). Here we need horizontal distance from the tilted surface to the point of divergence. From the diagram, considering geometry of deviation \\(\\delta\\),  the horizontal distance from the plane surface to the point of divergence  (along X-axis, which is approx normal to plane surface for small \\(\\theta\\)) can be approximated by considering tangent of deviation angle multiplied by vertical distance.\\nLet's find the x-coordinate of the image formed by the plane surface. For small \\(\\theta\\), the rays deviate by \\(\\delta\\) and appear to diverge from a point.  The height \\(y\\) of the point A from the optical axis (extended plane surface position) is approximately \\(d \\approx 0\\) for a thin lens. The horizontal shift is relevant.\\nLet's approximate that rays diverge from a point such that the tangent of deviation angle gives ratio of shift and horizontal distance.\\n\\(\\tan \\delta \\approx \\delta \\approx \\dfrac{BA}{v'}\\) where v' is distance where rays appear to diverge.\\nHowever, it is easier to consider refraction at the curved surface now using standard formula considering the rays are diverging from a virtual source after first refraction.\\n*(2) Refraction at the Curved Surface:*\\nNow consider refraction at the curved surface. For refraction at the curved surface, we use the formula for refraction from a spherical surface:\\n\\(\\dfrac{\\mu_2}{v} - \\dfrac{\\mu_1}{u} = \\dfrac{\\mu_2 - \\mu_1}{R}\\)\\nHere,\\n\\(\\mu_1 = \\mu\\) (refractive index of lens material)\\n\\(\\mu_2 = 1\\) (refractive index of air)\\n\\(R = -R\\) (Radius of curvature is negative for a concave surface, considering light from left to right)\\n\\(u = -\\infty\\) (since rays are initially parallel)\\nSubstituting these values, we get:\\n\\(\\dfrac{1}{v} - \\dfrac{\\mu}{-\\infty} = \\dfrac{1 - \\mu}{-R}\\)\\n\\(\\dfrac{1}{v} = -\\dfrac{(1 - \\mu)}{R} = \\dfrac{(\\mu - 1)}{R}\\)\\n\\(v = \\dfrac{R}{(\\mu - 1)}\\)\\nThe image distance \\(v\\) is positive, indicating that the image is formed on the right side of the curved surface. However, since we have a plano-concave lens and parallel rays, rays should diverge, meaning v should be negative. There is a sign issue in the formula.  Correct formula for refraction from curved surface, considering radius from right to left as positive is:\\n\\(\\dfrac{\\mu_2}{v} - \\dfrac{\\mu_1}{u} = \\dfrac{\\mu_2 - \\mu_1}{R}\\) where R is radius towards right. For plano concave R is negative here (as center towards left).\\nFor rays diverging, we should get negative value of v. Here R is given radius of curvature, consider magnitude. R is positive, and for plano-concave it's negative in sign convention, hence R = -R to be used in formula as per sign convention.\\nSo, with R = -R, \\n\\(\\dfrac{1}{v} = \\dfrac{1 - \\mu}{-R} = \\dfrac{(\\mu - 1)}{R}\\)\\n\\(v = \\dfrac{R}{(\\mu - 1)}\\) [This should be negative, indicating virtual image and divergence.]  If R is considered positive magnitude, we should have used R = +R for concave surface for rays from left to right based on cartesian sign convention, and formula would have been \\(\\dfrac{\\mu_2}{v} - \\dfrac{\\mu_1}{u} = \\dfrac{\\mu_2 - \\mu_1}{-R}\\) if Radius is towards left, and from pole to center is negative.  Then \\(\\dfrac{1}{v} = \\dfrac{\\mu-1}{-R} = -\\dfrac{(\\mu - 1)}{R}\\)\\n\\(v = -\\dfrac{R}{(\\mu - 1)}\\)\\nDistance from curved surface is \\(|v| = \\dfrac{R}{(\\mu - 1)}\\). The x-coordinate of point of divergence from curved surface is \\(x = -\\dfrac{R}{(\\mu - 1)}\\) (to the left of pole).\\nDue to deviation \\(\\delta\\) at plane surface, there is a vertical shift in the position of the point from which rays appear to diverge.  Lateral shift \\(BA = y\\). The angle of deviation was \\(\\delta = \\theta (1 - \\dfrac{1}{\\mu})\\). Vertical shift \\(y = BA = |v| \\tan \\delta \\approx |v| \\delta\\)\\n\\(y = BA = \\dfrac{R}{(\\mu - 1)} \\theta \\left(1 - \\dfrac{1}{\\mu}\\right) = R\\theta \\dfrac{(\\mu - 1)}{\\mu - 1} \\left(\\dfrac{\\mu - 1}{\\mu}\\right) = R\\theta \\dfrac{(\\mu - 1)}{\\mu}\\)\\n\\(y = R\\theta \\dfrac{(\\mu - 1)}{\\mu}\\)\\n\\(x = -\\dfrac{R}{(\\mu - 1)}\\)\\nCo-ordinates of point A where rays appear to diverge are \\((-\\dfrac{R}{(\\mu - 1)}, R\\theta \\dfrac{(\\mu - 1)}{\\mu}) = (-\\dfrac{R}{(\\mu - 1)}, kR\\theta)\\) where \\(k = \\dfrac{(\\mu - 1)}{\\mu}\\).\\nFrom the provided solution,  Co-ordinates of point A are given as \\((-\\dfrac{R}{(\\mu - 1)}, R\\theta)\\), which means the vertical shift is approximated as \\(R\\theta\\) and horizontal position as \\(-\\dfrac{R}{(\\mu - 1)}\\).\\nLet's re-examine vertical shift.  Vertical shift depends on horizontal distance and deviation angle. \\(y = |v| \\tan \\delta \\approx |v| \\delta\\). Yes, and \\(|v| = \\dfrac{R}{\\mu - 1}\\) and \\(\\delta = \\theta \\left(1 - \\dfrac{1}{\\mu}\\right)\\).\\n\\(y = \\dfrac{R}{(\\mu - 1)} \\cdot \\theta \\left(1 - \\dfrac{1}{\\mu}\\right) = \\dfrac{R}{(\\mu - 1)} \\cdot \\theta \\dfrac{(\\mu - 1)}{\\mu} = \\dfrac{R\\theta}{\\mu}\\). \\nAgain a factor of \\(\\mu\\) difference compared to the given answer. \\nRechecking Solution again, \\(BA = |v| r \\approx |v| \\theta\\), but deviation is \\(\\delta = \\theta (1 - \\dfrac{1}{\\mu})\\). \\(y = |v| \\delta = \\dfrac{R}{(\\mu - 1)} \\cdot \\theta (1 - \\dfrac{1}{\\mu}) = \\dfrac{R}{\\mu - 1} \\cdot \\theta \\dfrac{(\\mu - 1)}{\\mu} = \\dfrac{R\\theta}{\\mu}\\). I am getting \\(y = \\dfrac{R\\theta}{\\mu}\\). Provided answer shows vertical coordinate as \\(R\\theta\\). It seems there is factor of \\(\\dfrac{1}{\\mu}\\) difference.  The provided solution does not explicitly derive the vertical coordinate y, it directly states \\(BA = |v|r \\approx |v|\\theta = R \\theta \\dfrac{1}{\\mu - 1} \\theta \\approx R \\theta \\).\\nThere could be an approximation error in the provided solution in calculating vertical shift, it seems to miss factor \\(\\dfrac{1}{\\mu}\\).
