Given that initial separation between object and screen is four times the focal length. So, the object is initially at \(-2f\) from lens and image gets formed at \(2f\) on the screen. Here, \(f\) is the focal length of the lens.

Just after placement of slab, the object now appears slightly shifted towards the lens. Let us say such apparent shift in position of object is $\Delta t$. Now, the image on the screen will get blurred. So, some displacement of lens will be required towards the screen. Let the displacement of lens in be \(\Delta x\). After displacement of the lens, the object distance (or position) is $-\left(2f-\Delta t+\Delta x\right)$, while the new image distance becomes $\left(2f-\Delta x\right)$. Using lens formula:

$$\frac{1}{\left(2f-\Delta x\right)}-\frac{1}{-\left(2f-\Delta t+\Delta x\right)}=\frac{1}{f}$$ 

In the other situation, when the spab is placed between lens and the screen, the image again appears blurred. The lens this time requires to be shifted away from the screen, let us say by $\Delta y$. Now the new equation becomes:

$$\frac{1}{\left(2f+\Delta t-\Delta y\right)}-\frac{1}{-\left(2f+\Delta y\right)}=\frac{1}{f}$$

Using the above two equations with $f=25$ cm and $\Delta x = 2 \frac{4}{23}=\frac{50}{23}$, and substituting $\Delta t$ from one equation into other, we get:

$$\Delta y=2\text{cm}$$
