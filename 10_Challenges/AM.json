      "questionText": "You measure the period of a physical pendulum about one pivot point to be T. You then find another pivot point on the opposite side of the center of mass that gives the same period. The distance between these two points is L. Find an expression for g in terms of T and L. ",
      "solution": "Let the distance of the center of mass from the first pivot point be x. The period of a physical pendulum is given by:\n\\(T = 2\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{I_c + mx^2}{mgx}}\\)\nwhere \\(I_c\\) is the moment of inertia about the center of mass.\nLet the distance of the center of mass from the second pivot point be (L-x). The period about this point is given by:\n\\(T = 2\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{I_c + m(L-x)^2}{mg(L-x)}}\\)\nSince both periods are equal, we have:\n\\(\\frac{I_c + mx^2}{x} = \\frac{I_c + m(L-x)^2}{L-x}\\)\n\\(I_c(L-x) + mx^2(L-x) = I_c x + mx(L-x)^2\\)\n\\(I_c (L - 2x) = mx(L-x)(L-x-x) = mx(L-x)(L-2x)\\)\n\\(I_c = mx(L-x)\\)\nSubstituting this into the period equation for the first pivot point:\n\\(T = 2\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{mx(L-x) + mx^2}{mgx}} = 2\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{mxL - mx^2 + mx^2}{mgx}} = 2\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{Lx}{g}}\\)\n\\(\\implies T^2 = 4\\pi^2 \\frac{Lx}{g}\\)\nNow, we consider the case where the two pivot points are on opposite sides of the center of mass, and the period is the same for both points.  Let x be the distance of the center of mass from the first pivot point and L-x be the distance from the second pivot point.  The equation for the period is:\n\\(T = 2\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{I_c+mx^2}{mgx}} = 2\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{I_c+m(L-x)^2}{mg(L-x)}}\\)\nEquating these expressions and simplifying leads to the result:\n\\(I_c = mx(L-x)\\)\nSubstituting this back into the equation for the period and solving for g, we obtain:\n\\(g = \\frac{4\\pi^2 L}{T^2}\\)",
